Prompt:  1-Indanone is a drug that targets
 
Response: 1-Indanone is a drug that targets the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) to block pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that drive cardiac hypertrophy. β2AR agonists are used clinically for the treatment of heart failure and asthma, and they are the preferred treatment for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. We report here the structure of a pro-apoptotic peptide derived from the β2AR (β2AR-peptide) bound to the β2AR. This peptide induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and inhibits pro-hypertrophic signaling pathways. The β2AR-peptide is composed of two β2AR-specific domains, a small domain (SD) and a large domain (LD), and it has a unique structure with two-fold symmetry. The β2AR-peptide forms a complex with the β2AR with a 1:1 stoichiometry and binds to the receptor

Response: 2-Aminoethanethiol is a drug that targets the metabolism of the glutathione (GSH) redox system. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and has been shown to have anticancer effects. Here, we investigate the mechanism of inhibition of rheumatoid arthritis. We have developed a method for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and cysteamine in human plasma and urine using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The presence of cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and cysteamine in plasma and urine was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Cysteamine, the active metabolite of cysteine, was rapidly formed in the presence of cysteine in the presence of GSH and was eliminated slowly from plasma. The peak plasma concentration of cysteamine after administration of cysteine was 4.5 ± 0.

Prompt:  2-Thiouracil is a drug that targets
 
Response: 2-Thiouracil is a drug that targets a thymidine phosphorylase (TMP) enzyme that is highly expressed in cancer cells and can be used to treat cancer. In this study, we synthesized 4-N-(2-chloroethyl)-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione-4-carboxamide (4-CTC) and tested its effects on MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results showed that 4-CTC treatment led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. 4-CTC induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in a time-dependent manner, as well as apoptosis. Treatment with 4-CTC also induced a reduction in MMP and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, 4-CTC treatment induced a decrease in the expression of c-myc and c-fos and increased the expression of caspase-3 and p53.

Prompt:  3469-LCZ696 is a drug that targets
 
Response: 3469-LCZ696 is a drug that targets the Hedgehog pathway, an intracellular signalling pathway involved in development and homeostasis of the organism. The Hh pathway is involved in tumor growth and spread and its dysregulation is a feature of many cancer types. This drug has been studied in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, where it has shown a promising anti-tumor activity and was well tolerated in patients.

As it is the case of other Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, the action of IPI-504 is achieved by inhibiting the function of the SMO protein. However, the main difference between this drug and others is the mechanism of action, which has been linked to inhibition of the proteasome-dependent degradation of GLI2, a transcription factor involved in the Hedgehog pathway. As a result, the production of Hedgehog pathway-regulated genes is reduced, and the anti-tumor activity of the drug is observed in several cancer

Prompt:  4-Aminobenzoic is a drug that targets
 
Response: 4-Aminobenzoic is a drug that targets the hormone aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and that has anti-cancer properties in vitro and in vivo. Here we present the crystal structure of AhR in complex with an AhR agonist, 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (p,p'-DDE). The AhR structure reveals that a key amino acid in the conserved PAS-B domain is changed from asparagine to aspartic acid in human AhR, which is associated with a resistance to the drug. A molecular docking study indicates that the ligand binding site is formed by the side chains of the conserved residues. These findings suggest that the mutation may be responsible for the resistance of human AhR to the drug.

Prompt:  4-AMINOHIPPURIC is a drug that targets
 
Response: 4-AMINOHIPPURIC is a drug that targets the enzyme arginase. The mechanism of action of this drug is to lower the level of arginine in the blood. Arginase is a key enzyme that converts arginine to urea and ornithine. Ornithine is an intermediate in the production of collagen, the protein that gives cartilage its stiffness. The production of urea in the liver leads to a reduction in the amount of ammonia in the blood. The lower level of ammonia in the blood reduces the activity of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which can lead to the formation of the neurotoxin, glutamate. Therefore, by reducing the level of arginine, the formation of glutamate is reduced, which in turn reduces the production of ammonia.

Prompt:  4-Methyl-2-pentanone is a drug that targets
 
Response: 4-Methyl-2-pentanone is a drug that targets opioid receptors, which are involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.

Mechanism of action

Methyl-2-pentanone binds to the κ-opioid receptor, which is involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. It produces sedative effects by inhibiting the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the associated signaling pathways. Methyl-2-pentanone also has low affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, which is involved in the regulation of pain. It does not bind to the δ-opioid receptor, which is involved in the regulation of anxiety.

Pharmacokinetics

Following subcutaneous administration, methyl-2-pentanone has a very short half-life of 5 minutes. Following oral administration, methyl-2-pentanone is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations

Prompt:  4-Methylumbelliferone is a drug that targets
 
Response: 4-Methylumbelliferone is a drug that targets and reduces MMP-9 and IL-1β.

There are a number of compounds that can be used to treat osteoarthritis. In fact, many people prefer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over surgery, because NSAIDs relieve pain and reduce inflammation, thereby slowing down the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, however, NSAIDs can have serious side effects, including stomach irritation, bleeding, and heart problems. This makes the use of NSAIDs difficult, because people often do not want to take drugs that have side effects.

The good news is that there are drugs that can help with osteoarthritis without causing any of the negative side effects associated with NSAIDs. In fact, the use of MMP-9 and IL-1β inhibitors (including COX-2 inhibitors) is recommended by some physicians for treating osteoarthritis.

Prompt:  4SC-201(resminostat,BYK408740) is a drug that targets
 
Response: 4SC-201(resminostat,BYK408740) is a drug that targets the HIV-1 protein, Integrase. It was tested in Phase II clinical trials but it did not prove to be effective.

Description
SC-201 is an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase, which is an enzyme required for viral replication. Integrase attaches the viral genome to the host cell's DNA, and is thus a vital part of the HIV life cycle. It is the only approved drug that specifically targets the HIV-1 integrase enzyme, as well as a handful of other integrase inhibitors.

SC-201 has been tested as a potential treatment for HIV infection. It has been demonstrated to inhibit HIV-1 replication in human T-cells in vitro. It has also been shown to reduce viral load in HIV-infected human subjects. In a Phase II clinical trial, a significant reduction in viral load was observed in 20 of 30 patients. SC-

Prompt:  5-HTP is a drug that targets
 
Response: 5-HTP is a drug that targets the enzyme 5-HTP decarboxylase, thereby increasing the amount of 5-HTP in the body. Once this is done, the body is able to produce serotonin on its own. In addition, 5-HTP increases the amount of serotonin in the brain by inhibiting its breakdown. This means that the serotonin produced in the body and brain is actually more stable and lasts longer than the serotonin that is produced on its own. This is the exact opposite of the way SSRIs work.

Many people who use 5-HTP experience a variety of side effects, including constipation, diarrhea, headache, nausea, sleepiness, and sometimes, a "high" feeling.

5-HTP is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, although it is also useful for sleep disorders and ADHD.

Prompt:  5-Methoxytryptamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: 5-Methoxytryptamine is a drug that targets the 5-HT1A receptor and is under investigation for the treatment of depression and anxiety. The antidepressant-like effects of 5-Methoxytryptamine are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the 5-HT1A receptor is also expressed in the hippocampus, where the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of 5-Methoxytryptamine remain to be determined. To investigate this issue, we examined the antidepressant-like effects of 5-Methoxytryptamine in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression and in the tail suspension test (TST) model of depression. In the CMS model, the administration of 5-Methoxytryptamine (10 and 20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the duration of immobility in the TST, and increased suc

Response: Abacavir is a drug that targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme and has been shown to be effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication. Abacavir resistance was first reported in the late 1980s in children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and was linked to the development of hypersensitivity syndrome (HS).\[[@ref1]\] It was soon recognized that most cases of HS occurred in patients with a prior history of virologic failure on a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) containing regimen. Subsequent studies showed that in patients failing a NRTI containing regimen, the majority of mutations associated with HS occur in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and are characterized by low-level resistance to abacavir.\[[@ref2]\] It is now generally accepted that patients with HS have a higher risk of virologic failure when treated with abacavir.\[[@ref

Response: AC220 is a drug that targets the tyrosine kinase FLT3. This enzyme is found on the surface of leukemia cells and regulates the proliferation and survival of these cells. Sunitinib is an oral drug that targets the tyrosine kinase FLT3 and has been approved for the treatment of several types of leukemia and certain solid tumors. Although the drug is effective in the treatment of these cancers, resistance often develops and the side effects of the drug are often severe. In order to develop more effective drugs that are not as toxic to patients, it is important to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance and develop new drugs that can overcome resistance. We are using gene expression profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to the drug and in drug-resistant cells. The goal of this project is to use these genes to develop new drugs that can be used to overcome drug resistance.

Prompt:  Acarbose is a drug that targets
 
Response: Acarbose is a drug that targets the effects of the naturally occurring enzyme, α-glucosidase, which is found in the brush border of the small intestine. This enzyme is a critical enzyme in the digestion of carbohydrates.

In healthy people, α-glucosidase breaks down carbohydrates that are ingested into smaller, more easily digested pieces. With the help of α-glucosidase, carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, such as glucose and fructose, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy in the body.

If the α-glucosidase enzyme is inhibited, carbohydrates can’t be broken down and remain in the intestine, where they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, the carbohydrates aren’t absorbed and enter the large intestine. The remaining carbohydrates are fermented by bacteria in the large intestine, which produces gases and, in some cases, a

Prompt:  Aceglutamide is a drug that targets
 
Response: Aceglutamide is a drug that targets glutamate neurotransmission, a key mediator of both normal and pathological brain function. Glutamate plays a critical role in excitatory synaptic transmission and excitotoxicity. It is also a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is involved in many of the vital processes of the brain and spinal cord. When glutamate binds to the postsynaptic cell surface receptor, it causes a change in the postsynaptic cell that results in an increase in intracellular calcium. This causes a number of physiological responses including cell death (excitotoxicity).
Excitotoxicity is a common cause of neurological disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, head trauma, spinal cord injury, and diabetic neuropathy. These disorders may be due to excessive stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors. Excitatory amino acid receptors include N-methyl-D-aspartate (

Response: ACY-1215 is a drug that targets the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and is currently in phase I/II clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of the novel IKK inhibitor, BAY-11-7085, alone and in combination with the IKK inhibitor BAY-12-7085, a second-generation analog of the original BAY-11-7085. We found that BAY-12-7085 was more effective than BAY-11-7085 in suppressing tumor cell growth and in inducing apoptosis. Moreover, the combination of BAY-12-7085 and BAY-11-7085 resulted in an enhanced inhibition of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis compared with the single agent. These results suggest that BAY-12-7085 is a promising novel IKK inhibitor for the treatment of cancer.

Prompt:  ADALAT is a drug that targets
 
Response: ADALAT is a drug that targets a transcription factor called glucocorticoid receptor, or GR. Glucocorticoid receptors are found in all kinds of cells, but are most prominent in the immune system, and they regulate the production of white blood cells. In the immune system, GRs are expressed in many different kinds of cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. GRs are usually found in the cytoplasm in a bound state. When a GR is bound to its ligand, the receptor is inactive.

Glucocorticoids are hormones produced in the adrenal glands, which are part of the endocrine system. The body uses glucocorticoids to regulate many different biological processes. When stress is present, the body produces high levels of glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoids help to control the immune system and keep the body from overreacting to foreign antigens

Prompt:  ADENOSINE is a drug that targets
 
Response: ADENOSINE is a drug that targets an enzyme that regulates the way the body produces energy from food.

Some researchers think that it may help people who are overweight or obese. Others say it could be a major breakthrough in the treatment of diabetes.

It is one of the most popular drugs in the world. In the US, it is available as a generic drug.

There are no major side effects.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Adenosine is a natural chemical that helps to regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.

It is released when a person eats.

It also controls the rate at which sugar is released into the blood after eating.

Some people with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood.

Adenosine is a chemical that is naturally released by the body. It slows down the release of sugar into the blood.

This helps to reduce the amount of sugar in the blood.

Prompt:  ALESSE is a drug that targets
 
Response: ALESSE is a drug that targets the Src family of tyrosine kinases. It is effective in the treatment of a wide variety of human cancers, and has completed Phase I clinical trials. A major problem with this drug is its ability to induce cardiac side effects in patients. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the heart is a primary target of the Src family kinase inhibitors. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test this hypothesis. We will use in vitro models of cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to test the effect of Src family kinase inhibitors on cell growth, and assess the ability of Src family kinase inhibitors to alter cell survival pathways. We will also use an in vivo mouse model of acute myocardial infarction to test the effect of Src family kinase inhibitors on infarct size and cardiac function. In the proposed experiments we will use a Src family kin

Response: ALLERNAZE is a drug that targets TRPA1 and TRPV1, both of which are activated by noxious temperatures. The drug is thought to be safe for clinical use, but there have been no clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy.

Thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity are two common symptoms of neuropathic pain. For this reason, drugs that target TRPV1 or TRPA1 are widely used to treat this type of pain.

“We believe that CARs represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating neuropathic pain,” said Dr. Michael R. Caterina, the study’s senior author and the head of the Neuropathic Pain Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

“We showed that the drugs are highly effective in a rat model of neuropathic pain and they do not cause any significant side effects.”

Prompt:  ALLI is a drug that targets
 
Response: ALLI is a drug that targets c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of c-Abl tyrosine kinase induces apoptosis and decreases cellular proliferation and migration. These findings suggest that ALI could be a promising new therapeutic agent for the treatment of solid tumors. The effects of ALI on cellular apoptosis and proliferation were investigated using HCT-116 human colon cancer cells. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and the activation of caspase-3. The proliferation was evaluated by counting the cell numbers. We also investigated the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of ALI on cellular proliferation. ALI induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis-inducing effect of ALI was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3. ALI also suppressed the proliferation of HCT-116 cells. The anti-proliferative effect of ALI was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1

Prompt:  ALVESCO is a drug that targets
 
Response: ALVESCO is a drug that targets a defect in the sodium-potassium pump. This is a channel that helps to regulate the amount of sodium and potassium in your body. When the sodium-potassium pump is working properly, it helps to regulate your blood pressure and it helps your body to absorb salt.

When the sodium-potassium pump is not working properly, sodium and potassium build up in your body. This is what causes the problems associated with high blood pressure and heart problems.

HOW DOES ALVESCO WORK?

ALVESCO works by improving the function of the sodium-potassium pump. The pump is made up of proteins and this is how ALVESCO works to improve its function. The sodium-potassium pump is made up of four proteins.

Prompt:  Amcasertib is a drug that targets
 
Response: Amcasertib is a drug that targets the protein encoded by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene.

How should this information be interpreted?

Germline bcl-2 mutations are found in some cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but are associated with other types of lymphoma and lymphoproliferative disorders. There is a small amount of evidence that bcl-2 mutations may also play a role in lung cancer, but this is largely anecdotal.

What are the potential benefits?

Bcl-2-directed therapies are able to overcome the resistance to apoptosis that occurs when bcl-2 is overexpressed in lymphoma. Thus, bcl-2-directed therapies have demonstrated single-agent activity in a number of malignancies. In vitro studies suggest that bcl-2-directed therapies may have activity in NSCLC, but this has not been confirmed in clinical trials.

Response: AMG337 is a drug that targets the RSK3 protein, a protein that regulates the transcription factor CREB. It has been shown that AMG337 treatment can increase hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, but not locomotor activity. These results indicate that AMG337 can be used to increase the expression of CREB and its downstream targets in the hippocampus.

Another drug, D-2480, targets the protein kinase CK2 and has been shown to increase CREB phosphorylation and improve memory. However, D-2480 has also been shown to have neurotoxic effects in mice. Therefore, this drug may be more suitable for targeting brain regions other than the hippocampus.

Enhancing phosphorylation of CREB can also be accomplished through a different approach. Researchers have found that a substance called forskolin can be used to increase the activity of adenylate cyclase and subsequently increase the phosphorylation of CREB. Forskolin has been

Prompt:  Amikacin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Amikacin is a drug that targets cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bacteria, with a half-life of around 6-8 hours. A major disadvantage of amikacin is its relatively low potency, which can be attributed to its poor penetration of the bacterial cytoplasm and its inability to diffuse through the outer membrane.[@b1-asm-3-247] Amikacin is also used as a potentiator of beta-lactam antibiotics. It is usually given as a single dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. The plasma concentration of amikacin in healthy individuals is approximately 10 μg/mL. The usual dosage of amikacin in patients with cystic fibrosis is 1-2 mg/kg/day, which is administered intravenously.[@b2-asm-3-247]

Prompt:  AMINOCAPROIC is a drug that targets
 
Response: AMINOCAPROIC is a drug that targets a certain enzyme in the liver called aminocaproic acid, or ACP, and stops it from breaking down fibrin. It has been used in Europe for decades, but it is now gaining a new reputation in the United States.

We used to know that the fibrin formed in a blood clot was “sticky” and that once it was formed, it would be the mainstay of the clot. That is no longer the case. Now, we know that the fibrin in a clot is the end result of a series of processes that occur within the clot itself. The fibrin is not sticky, but it is the end result of a process that is a bit like a biochemical reaction.

This process begins when the blood vessel that has been damaged or cut releases a protein called plasmin. Plasmin breaks down the fibrin that has already been formed

Prompt:  Aminoguanidine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Aminoguanidine is a drug that targets protein modification and the response to oxidative stress. It is a nucleophilic compound and inhibits the formation of carbonyl derivatives. It is used to prevent the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that are formed when proteins react with glucose and other reducing sugars. AGEs accumulate with age, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Aminoguanidine inhibits the formation of cross-linked, fluorescent AGEs by binding covalently to AGE precursors. AGEs can be detected in serum and urine and the level of AGEs correlates with disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

We studied the ability of aminoguanidine to prevent the formation of AGEs in healthy volunteers who were treated with vitamin C and [1,2,3,4,5-5H]5-hydroxytrypt

Prompt:  AMINOPHYLLINE is a drug that targets
 
Response: AMINOPHYLLINE is a drug that targets protein translation by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and thereby blocking the translation of all mRNAs that contain the 5′ terminal m^7^G-cap structure. eIF2α phosphorylation is mediated by two kinases, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI). Upon virus infection, PKR and HRI phosphorylate eIF2α and inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs ([@bib26]; [@bib15]). However, viruses have evolved strategies to evade eIF2α-mediated translational repression and to hijack the translational machinery to generate their own proteins ([@bib27]). For example, the dsRNA binding protein, PKR, and the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR-like endoplasmic

Response: Aminosalicylate is a drug that targets the gastrointestinal mucosa and is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The pharmacology of aminosalicylates is well known, but the mechanism of action is still unclear. We hypothesize that the effect of aminosalicylates on gut epithelial cells involves regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation. We studied the effect of two aminosalicylates on the growth and differentiation of human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC). We found that aminosalicylates inhibit HIEC growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibition was associated with cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase transition. Aminosalicylates also induced apoptosis of HIEC. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of 5-aminosalicylic acid was lower than that of mesalazine. The inhibition of HIEC growth by aminosalicylates was

Prompt:  Angiotensin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Angiotensin is a drug that targets the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This system is a cascade of reactions that starts with renin and ends with angiotensin II (Ang II). The RAS regulates blood pressure, electrolyte balance, vascular tone, and renal function. In the early 1900s, an increased knowledge of the RAS was translated into new medical therapies. In the 1950s, the discovery of the first enzyme in the RAS (renin) and the availability of radioimmunoassays for angiotensinogen (the protein that makes renin) opened the door to the new medical field of RAS research. In the 1970s, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was discovered and its role in the RAS became apparent. This enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, was also the first drug target in the RAS. The discovery of

Prompt:  Anidulafungin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Anidulafungin is a drug that targets the enzyme phospholipase C, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 causes the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn activates protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine/threonine protein kinases. PKC activation causes the phosphorylation of a number of substrates, including ion channels, pumps, exchangers, and transporters, resulting in altered cell membrane potential, increased cytoplasmic calcium, altered gene expression, and other cellular responses. Anidulafungin also inhibits the activity of the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which hydroly

Prompt:  Anisodamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Anisodamine is a drug that targets the adrenergic receptor (α-AR). In fact, the drug has been used for the treatment of high blood pressure, especially that caused by certain types of ureteral stones, by inhibiting the secretion of adrenaline from the adrenal gland. The effects of anisodamine are similar to those of ephedrine.

Although it has been shown that anisodamine is effective for treating the above conditions, it has not been widely used because of its relatively high price. However, anisodamine is inexpensive when compared to other anti-hypertensive drugs. Moreover, the oral administration of anisodamine is convenient, and its effects are immediate. For these reasons, anisodamine is expected to be used as an alternative for the treatment of high blood pressure.

Prompt:  ARRY-380 is a drug that targets
 
Response: ARRY-380 is a drug that targets the AR gene and may be used to treat prostate cancer. In this study, we assessed the relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and the efficacy and safety of AR-380 in patients with prostate cancer. Patients were genotyped for CYP2D6 polymorphisms, and their genotype was associated with AR-380 exposure. The patients were then divided into two groups based on CYP2D6 genotype. A pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed in each group to compare the PK of AR-380. The primary endpoint was the difference in AR-380 exposure between the two groups. In total, 51 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of the patients was 69 years, and their median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.1 ng/mL. The CYP2D6 genotype was extensive metabolizer in 24 patients, intermediate metabolizer in 22 patients, and poor

Prompt:  Artemether is a drug that targets
 
Response: Artemether is a drug that targets the malaria parasite *Plasmodium falciparum* and is widely used for treatment of uncomplicated malaria \[[@CIT0001]\]. It has been available for over 40 years and is one of the few remaining antimalarials. In clinical trials, the use of artemether has been associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events and a higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions compared with artesunate, and it has been used for over a decade in the United States \[[@CIT0002]\].

Artemether is a racemic mixture of 2 stereoisomers, diastereomers that differ in their physical properties, such as the absolute configuration of the chiral carbon atom. There are 3 artemether isomers, L, D, and M, which differ in the configuration of the stereocenter at carbon 2 (2*S*,2′*S*,2″

Prompt:  Artemisinin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Artemisinin is a drug that targets parasite kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), a unique mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in *Plasmodium* species. It has a relatively short half-life and is rapidly metabolized into a variety of compounds with diverse pharmacological activities ([@B11]). Artemisinin derivatives are the most important anti-malarial drugs and are also a potent antimalarial therapy for human *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives have been used as a treatment for many other diseases, including inflammatory, bacterial, viral, and protozoan diseases ([@B6]). Moreover, it is one of the most potent anti-tumor drugs, particularly for the treatment of glioma ([@B9]). Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of artemisinin and its derivatives, the mechanism of action of these compounds remains unclear.

Prompt:  Artesunate is a drug that targets
 
Response: Artesunate is a drug that targets multiple stages of the *Plasmodium* life cycle. It is currently the most effective treatment for malaria, but resistance to this drug is emerging rapidly, leading to a global public health crisis ([@B1]). Resistance is thought to be the result of multiple, independent mutations that alter drug-target interactions and drug efflux ([@B2]). In the absence of new drugs, resistance is rapidly selected for in areas of intense drug use, and there is concern that the use of current antimalarials will be limited in the future by the risk of developing resistance ([@B3]). However, the success of the World Health Organization\'s Global Action Plan for Artemisinin Resistance and its impact on the development of resistance to other antimalarials has yet to be determined ([@B4]).

Prompt:  Articaine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Articaine is a drug that targets the nerve endings of the tooth. When injected into the tooth, it provides pain relief and helps in reducing sensitivity and inflammation. The drug is an anesthetic and works in a similar way as other anesthetics. However, it is administered as a local anesthetic that is absorbed into the tooth and travels to the nerve endings. The drug helps in relaxing the tooth, thereby making the tooth numb. The drug has a quick onset and lasts for only 3 to 4 hours. It is used to numb the nerves of the teeth and relieve pain. It is an effective solution for people who are suffering from toothache and sensitivity and who do not wish to undergo root canal treatment.

Prompt:  Aspartame is a drug that targets
 
Response: Aspartame is a drug that targets your brain to control your behavior and give you an altered reality. It is a drug, a poison that destroys the body and mind.

FDA approved aspartame for use in the US in 1985, and it was approved in Canada in 1987. It was then sold in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere.

Aspartame has a very high concentration of phenylalanine, which the brain uses to make serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters.

Aspartame is a drug that has been heavily marketed to the public, and the same scientists who made it have made billions of dollars from it. They don’t want to stop making aspartame, and they don’t want you to know the truth about it.

Prompt:  aspirin is a drug that targets
 
Response: aspirin is a drug that targets the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, with two isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) of which COX-2 is thought to be the primary source of pain and inflammation. It has been found that a high-fat diet (HFD) can lead to increased COX-2 expression in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), suggesting that COX-2 is a target of dietary fat. However, the effects of HFD on the DRG have not been previously investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a HFD on COX-2 expression in the DRG and the pain response to peripheral inflammation. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a HFD or control diet for 12 weeks. After the 12-week period, rats were given either saline or carrageenan (1%) to the right hindpaw, and

Prompt:  atovaquone is a drug that targets
 
Response: atovaquone is a drug that targets *Plasmodium*'s apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle that is essential for parasite growth. It has been reported that *Plasmodium* uses this organelle to synthesize fatty acids that are incorporated into the parasite's plasma membrane, where they serve as anchors for a unique parasite-derived lipoprotein, LPCAT. LPCAT plays an important role in the maturation of the parasite's host-derived apical organelle, the microneme vesicle, which is critical for parasite invasion. Parasites treated with atovaquone have fewer micronemes, and therefore, fewer infectious forms, in their blood meal. As a result, mosquitoes become infected less often and the overall parasite population decreases.

Prompt:  Auranofin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Auranofin is a drug that targets thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a protein that is found in all organisms. This enzyme is essential for the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive compounds produced by cellular metabolism that are a by-product of aerobic metabolism. ROS are normal by-products of normal cellular function, but they can be highly destructive to cellular structures if their concentration is too high. Auranofin inhibits TrxR and is therefore able to lower ROS levels.

The mechanism of action of auranofin has been studied for many years and involves several important steps. The first step is the binding of the drug to the enzyme. Once bound, the drug is then converted to a thiol reactive compound that is then able to bind to the active site of the enzyme. In this way, the drug prevents the enzyme from functioning normally.

Prompt:  Azasetron is a drug that targets
 
Response: Azasetron is a drug that targets the 5-HT~3~ receptor. This receptor is highly expressed on the sensory neurons that detect the stomach contents, and 5-HT~3~ receptor antagonists block the urge to vomit that is triggered by these stimuli. These drugs have been shown to be useful in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and as a consequence are widely used in the oncology setting.^[@bib1]^ The exact mechanism of action of these drugs is not fully understood, but the 5-HT~3~ receptor antagonist binds to the serotonin 5-HT~3~ receptor on sensory neurons, and has been shown to inhibit depolarization of the sensory neuron and reduce the sensitivity of the neuron to gastric distension.^[@bib2]^ These effects are thought to be the mechanism for the reduction in the urge to vomit that is seen with these drugs.

Prompt:  AZD3759 is a drug that targets
 
Response: AZD3759 is a drug that targets the Akt pathway. The drug is a potent, selective, and orally available inhibitor of Akt, with low toxicity. This drug has been shown to have potent antitumor activity in preclinical models and to induce tumor regression in several tumor types. However, this drug has limited clinical activity in patients with solid tumors. A potential explanation for this limited clinical activity is that the drug does not induce tumor cell apoptosis. We hypothesized that inhibition of Akt would also inhibit cell proliferation in B-cell malignancies. In this study, we evaluated the effect of AZD3759 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human B-cell malignancies. In vitro proliferation assays were performed using several B-cell malignancies. AZD3759 inhibited proliferation of B-cell malignancies with different sensitivity, ranging from complete inhibition of proliferation in the Ramos cell line to minor effects in the TMD8 cell line.

Prompt:  Azlocillin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Azlocillin is a drug that targets bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria that may cause a problem such as diarrhoea or infection. Azlocillin is an antibiotic drug and belongs to the penicillin group of antibiotics.

Azlocillin works by interfering with the function of the bacterial cell wall. Bacteria do not grow normally when they do not have a cell wall. Azlocillin makes the cell wall weaker, so that the cell wall does not hold together as well. When the cell wall breaks down, the bacteria die.

Azlocillin may also work by affecting the production of the cell wall. Azlocillin may prevent the bacteria from making the cell wall. It may also make the cell wall thicker. Azlocillin may also stop the bacteria from growing and reproduce.

Azlocillin may also affect the production of proteins inside the bacteria. Azlocillin may stop the bacteria from making proteins, so that the bacteria

Prompt:  Benazepril is a drug that targets
 
Response: Benazepril is a drug that targets the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) enzyme, thereby inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which in turn inhibits the actions of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, through activation of the angiotensin II receptor, stimulates aldosterone secretion, thereby increasing the production of water and sodium in the body. Benazepril, by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, lowers the level of angiotensin II in the body, thereby reducing aldosterone secretion.
Benazepril is a prodrug, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active form benazeprilat (also known as enalaprilat). Benazeprilat is the active moiety of benazepril. Benazeprilat is an inhibitor of the ACE enzyme, and thus acts to inhibit the

Prompt:  BENEMID is a drug that targets
 
Response: BENEMID is a drug that targets the beta-amyloid protein (Aβ), the protein that is deposited in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. It is thought that Aβ accumulates in the brain as a result of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage by β-secretase, and that this protein cleavage is inhibited by the drug. Beta-secretase cleaves APP at the amino-terminus of Aβ, releasing a large soluble ectodomain fragment of APP, sAPPβ, and an amino-terminal membrane-bound C-terminal fragment, C99. C99 can then be further processed by γ-secretase to release Aβ.
The two β-secretase enzymes (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1 and BACE2) have been identified and are closely related in amino acid sequence. BACE2 is also known as “ADAM10�

Prompt:  BENOQUIN is a drug that targets
 
Response: BENOQUIN is a drug that targets MAO-A, an enzyme that is a part of the enzyme system that breaks down many neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When the enzyme MAO-A is inhibited, the neurotransmitters remain longer in the synapse, and more dopamine can be released into the synapse, resulting in increased stimulation of the dopamine receptors. Because the primary target of the drug is the enzyme MAO-A, MAO-B inhibition does not produce the same kind of effect as MAO-A inhibition.

How is it used?

It is used to treat some symptoms of depression, and to prevent the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It is also used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic attacks, and other conditions.

What is the mechanism of action?

The drug is used to treat depression and OCD by inhibiting the enzyme MAO-A, which breaks down dopamine.

Prompt:  Benzydamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Benzydamine is a drug that targets and kills cancer cells by triggering a cell death pathway called apoptosis. It is an example of a cancer cell killer drug that can be used to treat certain types of cancer.

It was approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of genital warts.

Its mechanism of action is as follows:

In the case of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, it inhibits the HPV-associated protein kinase. This inhibition causes the HPV-associated protein kinase to activate an enzyme called PKC, which then phosphorylates the HPV-associated protein kinase.

The phosphorylated protein is then cleaved and inactivated by a protease called caspase 3.

This causes the HPV-associated protein kinase to lose its ability to activate PKC.

Inhibition of PKC causes the HPV-associated protein kinase to be inactive, which prevents it from triggering cell division

Prompt:  bephenium is a drug that targets
 
Response: bephenium is a drug that targets CDKs. These are a group of proteins that control cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. They can be divided into two subgroups: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinases (CDKLs). The latter group is related to CDKs and also functions in the cell cycle.

Studies on the biological activity of bephenium are few. However, it was observed that the compound is able to inhibit CDK1 in HeLa cells. This inhibition is followed by a decrease in the number of HeLa cells in S-phase and a delay in cell cycle progression.

The exact mechanism of bephenium on CDKs has not been determined. Bephenium can inhibit CDKs by a non-competitive mechanism or by a competitive mechanism.

Response: Besifovir is a drug that targets a protein (called p62) involved in the protein translation process. It is used to treat some types of cancer, and is also being developed for HIV treatment.

The results of the study were published in Nature Biotechnology.

“Our findings show that even in the absence of drug treatment, the cellular composition of the tumor is altered. The ‘microenvironment’ is changed, and this might be an important factor for cancer treatment and prognosis,” said Sjoerd van de Sande, senior author of the study.

“The results also show that the protein translation process is active even in the absence of the target protein, p62,” said Torben Christensen, senior author of the study.

“This might be the mechanism by which the tumor cells maintain a high growth rate and thereby make the cancer difficult to treat.”

Prompt:  Bestatin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Bestatin is a drug that targets the enzyme trypsin, which is responsible for the digestion of pancreatic protein. A form of amylase (a digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas) is secreted into the digestive tract, and trypsin is needed to break down the amylase. By inhibiting trypsin, the amylase stays in the digestive tract, which prevents it from getting into the blood and causing an allergic reaction. This drug is usually given to patients with pancreatitis.

BEVERAGES, SPORTS DRINKS, and SPRAYS

There are two kinds of sports drinks: carbohydrate-rich ones and non-carbohydrate ones. There are also three kinds of protein drinks: the traditional ones, the ones that are sweetened, and the ones that have a higher proportion of protein to carbohydrate. The three kinds of protein drinks also vary in the amount of protein and carbohydrate they contain. Some sports drinks are made with caffeine and other stimulants to increase the heart rate and energy level.

Prompt:  Betamipron is a drug that targets
 
Response: Betamipron is a drug that targets the prostaglandin F2a receptor. The prostaglandin F2a receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines and other biological mediators, and its blockade is thought to attenuate inflammation. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are known to inhibit prostaglandin production in the airways and to increase mucociliary clearance in the airways. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are also known to cause bronchodilation and mucus secretion in the airways. The prostaglandin F2a receptor and beta-2 adrenergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that share a common pharmacologic target, the Gi protein. The Gi protein functions to inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that generates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key second messenger molecule.

Prompt:  BETAPAR is a drug that targets
 
Response: BETAPAR is a drug that targets the same pathway as leflunomide.

Like leflunomide, BETAAPAR can inhibit T cell activation by blocking the pyrimidine pathway. However, BETAAPAR is much more selective for the pyrimidine pathway than leflunomide, as it does not inhibit the NF-kB pathway. BETAAPAR also has a unique side-effect profile. Unlike leflunomide, which can cause mouth ulcers and diarrhea, BETAAPAR does not cause these side-effects.

BETAAPAR was initially discovered by researchers at H. Lundbeck A/S, and was then developed by GlaxoSmithKline. In January of 2011, the FDA approved BETAAPAR for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The manufacturer has also announced that BETAAPAR is being studied for the treatment of psoriasis.

Response: BIBW2992 is a drug that targets the intracellular fatty acid-binding protein, FABP5. The role of FABP5 in regulating the transport of long-chain fatty acids in macrophages has been demonstrated, and FABP5 is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that IBWB2992 may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of plaque rupture.

We chose to use low doses of IBWB2992 in this study. A previous study showed that mice treated with 10 mg/kg/day of IBWB2992 for 8 weeks showed no toxicity and no changes in liver, kidney, or other organ functions ([@b24-etm-0-0-3109]).

One of the major issues that has slowed the development of new drugs that target this system is that this system is involved in so many different types of behaviors. In the case of animals, the major behavior that is targeted by this system is that of aggression. This system is called the Serotonin Receptor Type 3 (5-HT3R) and it is a G-protein coupled receptor that has a high affinity for serotonin. Drugs that target this system have been developed for a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. In the case of humans, there are many different 5-HT3R agonists that have been developed that are used to treat a number of different disorders.

Prompt:  Bisacodyl is a drug that targets
 
Response: Bisacodyl is a drug that targets the large intestine, helping to reduce intestinal spasms, and also relaxing the rectum and anus. It works by stimulating the nerves in the wall of the intestine, resulting in a reduction in the pressure and the frequency of the contractions. The spasms are also less intense, resulting in a decreased need for bowel movements.

The manufacturer of the drug, Alpharma, makes two other products that are used to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome. They are Alubix and Dulcolax. These drugs are sometimes referred to as antispasmodics, and they work by relaxing the muscles of the intestine, which are also stimulated by bisacodyl.

Prompt:  Bismuth is a drug that targets
 
Response: Bismuth is a drug that targets the causative agent of chronic diarrhoea (CD) -- *Giardia lamblia* ([@bib10]). The drug is efficacious, but requires a long period of treatment and suffers from a high rate of treatment failure ([@bib16]). Consequently, it is used only in areas of high prevalence of CD, and for children who have failed other treatments. This leaves the drug available only to a small proportion of patients with the disease.

One possible approach to increasing the availability of bismuth is to develop a cheap, rapid, point-of-care test that is able to detect the presence of *Giardia* in a faecal sample. Such a test would be valuable for the treatment of acute giardiasis, which is the most common form of the disease, and which is associated with a shorter duration of symptoms than chronic giardiasis.

Prompt:  BMS-833923 is a drug that targets
 
Response: BMS-833923 is a drug that targets an enzyme called the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE-1). NHE-1 helps the body to remove sodium from the cells and re-import potassium into the cells. This is important because sodium is responsible for the movement of water in and out of cells. When sodium is removed from the cells, the body can remove excess water and swelling from the cells and can also help the body to absorb water from the intestine and increase the blood flow to the kidneys to remove more water.

BMS-833923 is used to treat acute renal failure (ARF) in people with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. ARF is a serious condition where the kidneys stop working normally. This can lead to fluid retention in the body and problems with the heart and blood.

BMS-833923 can be used in combination with other medicines, including erythropoietin, in people with chronic kidney disease

Prompt:  Bromocriptine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Bromocriptine is a drug that targets the central nervous system. It was initially used to treat hyperprolactinemia and hypercorticism. However, it was later discovered that it has the potential to treat many more diseases, including obesity, schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson's disease.

Bromocriptine works by binding to the dopamine receptor. When it binds to the receptor, it causes the receptor to activate the enzyme adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn triggers the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activates cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which regulates gene expression and cellular function.

Bromocriptine also increases the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. This is why it is used to treat depression and anxiety.

Prompt:  Buspirone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Buspirone is a drug that targets the 5-HT1A receptor, and it has been widely used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,731,351, 6,124,338, 6,436,971, and 6,432,902).
However, buspirone is reported to have a low margin of safety in the human population (U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,351). Therefore, there is a need for developing buspirone analogs with higher safety and lower side effects.
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to novel buspirone analogs that exhibit higher safety and lower side effects.

Prompt:  BUSULFEX is a drug that targets
 
Response: BUSULFEX is a drug that targets the polyphosphate kinase (PPK) activity of the beta subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). eIF2 is an important protein in the regulation of protein synthesis. It functions as a GTP-dependent factor in the initiation of translation of eukaryotic mRNAs. A study in yeast demonstrated that inhibition of PPK in the beta subunit of eIF2 causes an increase in eIF2B and a decrease in eIF2-dependent protein synthesis. It was also shown that the beta subunit of eIF2 binds GTP and can serve as a GTP-dependent protein-protein receptor. In addition, it has been shown that the polyphosphate chain of eIF2 is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. The inhibition of PPK by the drug, BU-2116, blocks the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Thus, the drug

Response: Caffeic is a drug that targets the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is a crucial regulator of gene expression during the cell cycle, particularly during the G2 phase. The PRC2 is a conserved protein complex that controls the transcription of specific genes through its catalytic subunit EZH2.

The PRC2 is a highly conserved complex that can be found in plants, insects, nematodes, and vertebrates. This complex was first identified in *Drosophila* in 1997 and was the first complex to be identified that acts as a repressor of gene expression in a specific way. The PRC2 is responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which in turn leads to the recruitment of other transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling enzymes. The PRC2 is essential for embryonic development and the maintenance of adult stem cells and also regulates

Prompt:  CAPITAL is a drug that targets
 
Response: CAPITAL is a drug that targets a mutation in a gene called BRCA1. When a woman inherits the mutation, it can cause breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 is a protein that is part of a larger system that prevents cancer from growing and spreading. BRCA1 normally works by telling other parts of the system when it is time to start repairing damaged cells. The mutation in BRCA1 means that it cannot do this. It has a "faulty" gene, and so cannot do its job.

Capital is designed to correct this faulty gene. It is injected into the patient's body. It travels to the cell with the faulty gene and corrects the gene's DNA. It is thought that this is a good thing.

Before Capital was available, women with the BRCA1 mutation were offered surgery to remove their breasts and ovaries, and then chemotherapy to try to prevent the cancer from returning.

Prompt:  CAPITROL is a drug that targets
 
Response: CAPITROL is a drug that targets the transcription factor HIF-1. In normoxia, CAPITROL competes with the oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHDs) for binding to HIF-1α, thus preventing the hydroxylation of HIF-1α, which is necessary for the recognition and subsequent degradation of HIF-1α by the proteasome. In the presence of oxygen, PHDs hydroxylate HIF-1α, allowing for its degradation. As a result, HIF-1α is not degraded, which then activates the transcription of genes required for angiogenesis and erythropoiesis.

Prompt:  carbadox is a drug that targets
 
Response: carbadox is a drug that targets two key enzymes in the biosynthesis of vitamin B12, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. 

Vitamin B12 is essential for normal red blood cell production and for the growth and maintenance of all cells and tissues. In adults, B12 is absorbed by the intestines from food and is then taken up by the liver. The liver stores excess B12 as the inactive form methylcobalamin, which is then released into the bloodstream when needed. In children and pregnant women, vitamin B12 is also absorbed by the intestine and transported to the liver.

Disease states that affect the absorption, distribution, or excretion of vitamin B12 may result in vitamin B12 deficiency.

Prompt:  CARBILEV is a drug that targets
 
Response: CARBILEV is a drug that targets microtubules and has been approved for use in Japan and Europe to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate cancer. We aimed to determine whether carbilene-based drugs inhibit tubulin polymerization *in vitro* and the mechanism by which this occurs.

1. Introduction {#sec1-toxins-11-00603}
===============

Microtubules (MTs) are long, hollow, tubular protein polymers that are composed of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. These heterodimers polymerize into MTs in the cytoplasm and are involved in many cellular processes, including the maintenance of the cytoskeleton, cell division, cell motility, and intracellular trafficking. In cancer cells, MTs are frequently disorganized and their normal function is perturbed.

MTs are highly dynamic structures, which undergo dynamic instability,

Prompt:  Carbimazole is a drug that targets
 
Response: Carbimazole is a drug that targets the thioredoxin reductase system. This system plays a major role in the reduction of protein disulfide bonds.

When taken orally, the medication is converted into a sulfur compound called thiocarbamide. This compound can bind to the cysteine residues in the active sites of the thioredoxin reductase enzyme.

Because of this, carbimazole can inhibit the reduction of disulfide bonds in the active sites of the enzyme, thus blocking the reduction of other proteins.

Carbimazole can be used to treat a condition called hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is an overactive thyroid gland. In this condition, the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormone. This condition causes a number of symptoms including a rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, and weight loss.

When taken orally, the medication can work by inhibiting the reduction of thyroid hormone,

Prompt:  Casanthranol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Casanthranol is a drug that targets cancer cells that have a high expression of a particular growth factor receptor, in particular the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). In addition, the drug binds to the insulin receptor, but the drug's ability to bind to and interfere with the IGF-1R is approximately ten times greater than the ability to bind to and interfere with the insulin receptor. The most common mechanism of action of caner is the mutation of a growth factor receptor or a growth factor receptor kinase. As a result, the growth factor receptor is overexpressed in cancer cells. In contrast, the normal tissues of the body do not express the growth factor receptors at a high enough level to be affected by caner drugs.

Response: Catharanthine is a drug that targets the Hsp90 molecular chaperone. Hsp90 is required for the maturation and function of many proteins that are implicated in cancer. Hsp90 inhibitors are in clinical trials for a number of cancers. This is an opinion piece discussing the value of targeting Hsp90 in cancer therapy.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with the potential to become resistant to multiple therapeutic agents. This resistance is often associated with a change in the expression of a single gene, the role of which is to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells. In this regard, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an attractive therapeutic target in cancer therapy.

Prompt:  CB-839 is a drug that targets
 
Response: CB-839 is a drug that targets the protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) to inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. PKCδ plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that PKCδ plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of CB-839 on AR signaling and the underlying mechanism of CB-839-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. We found that CB-839 effectively inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and downregulated the expression of AR in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or bicalutamide (ICI), and significantly inhibited the expression of AR target genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the downregulation of AR signaling was responsible for the induction of apoptosis by CB-839 in prostate cancer cells. In addition

Response: CEFTIN is a drug that targets the CREB family of transcription factors. In cancer, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. However, cAMP/PKA-independent effects of CREB have also been demonstrated in cancer cells. Here we show that the novel cAMP-independent inhibitor of CREB, CEFTIN, is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth and migration, as well as angiogenesis. CEFTIN inhibited both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent signaling through CREB in breast cancer cells, as well as signaling through CREB-independent pathways. We found that CEFTIN directly binds to CREB in vitro and inhibits CREB-mediated transcription in cells. In addition, CEFTIN downregulated cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and survivin in breast cancer cells.

It is an effective analgesic and can be used as a stand-alone or adjunctive treatment for patients who have moderate to severe pain. Chlorquinaldol can be given orally or intravenously and is often used for short-term relief of moderate to severe pain.

Mechanism of action

Chlorquinaldol acts by inhibiting the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin into the nerve endings. This prevents their depletion and therefore increases the amount of these neurotransmitters in the synapse, which causes a decrease in pain.

Chlorquinaldol also causes the release of endorphins in the body, which are the body’s own natural pain killers. It also increases the

Prompt:  Chlortetracycline is a drug that targets
 
Response: Chlortetracycline is a drug that targets the ribosome, the organelle in which proteins are made. It is used to treat infections caused by bacteria that produce chlortetracycline-resistant (CTR) ribosomes. For this reason, CTR bacteria have become increasingly prevalent. This drug is now known to be a potent inducer of CTR bacteria, and has been shown to be more effective than erythromycin in inducing CTR in vitro.

In this study, we found that erythromycin and tetracycline are more effective in inducing CTR than chlortetracycline in vitro, as shown by a tetracycline-resistant gene that is found in a subpopulation of the CTR bacteria.

In the late 1980s, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a new antibiotic, chlortetracycline (CTC), for the treatment of infections caused by chl

Prompt:  Chlorzoxazone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Chlorzoxazone is a drug that targets the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE signaling pathway and has shown its therapeutic effect in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in animal models. However, its clinical application has been limited by its high cost, poor bioavailability, and the need for parenteral administration. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel method of transdermal delivery of chlorzoxazone. Chlorzoxazone is a poorly water-soluble drug, and a topical formulation was developed using a pressure-sensitive adhesive patch. The release rate of chlorzoxazone from the patch was determined using in vitro release testing, and the in vivo skin permeation rate was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. The safety of chlorzoxazone was evaluated using in vitro cytotoxicity tests. The in vivo efficacy of chlorzoxazone was investigated using an IRI model

Prompt:  Chondroitin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Chondroitin is a drug that targets neuroinflammation in the brain.

Neuroinflammation is a process in which microglia cells in the brain become activated and cause inflammation in the brain. Microglia cells are also known as macrophages in the brain.

Microglia cells have phagocytic ability, meaning that they can take up and break down unwanted particles in the brain.

Microglia cells can become activated in various neurological conditions.

The most common neuroinflammatory condition is multiple sclerosis (MS).

MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system.

In MS, microglia cells become activated and release a number of inflammatory mediators.

This causes inflammation in the brain and the body.

It has been shown that chondroitin has the ability to reduce neuroinflammation in the brain.

It can also reduce the inflammation in the body.

This is important because

Prompt:  Chromium is a drug that targets
 
Response: Chromium is a drug that targets a single pathway of the body. It is not a single drug, but rather a cocktail of nutrients that help support the body in its effort to regulate hormones. The idea behind chromium is that if the body is in balance, it will not be driven by the hormonal imbalances that cause weight gain. The result is that you will lose weight, not gain it.

The FDA-approved use of chromium is for diabetes, and it is available in pill form. Chromium also has been used for many years in alternative medicine for people who are overweight.

You can take chromium as a pill, or as a dietary supplement. Some people take chromium in pill form and others take it in dietary supplement form. Most of the research on chromium has been on the use of chromium in pill form, and therefore most of the information about chromium in dietary supplements is derived from that.

Prompt:  Climbazole is a drug that targets
 
Response: Climbazole is a drug that targets the fungus that causes athlete’s foot. Climacemide is an antihistamine that is used to relieve the symptoms of allergies.

Mixing Climacemide and Climazole Can Be Harmful

Climacemide and Climazole are both drugs that are commonly used to treat fungal infections. However, it is important to note that the two drugs have different mechanisms of action.

While Climacemide is an antihistamine, Climazole is a drug that targets fungal infections. Therefore, it is possible for a person to take Climacemide and Climazole at the same time.

In addition, it is possible for someone to take one drug and then combine it with another drug that interacts with the same system. This is why it is important to always read the labels of the medications you are taking.

It is also important to note that Clim

Prompt:  CP868569 is a drug that targets
 
Response: CP868569 is a drug that targets PDE10A. The effect of PDE10A inhibition was evaluated in this study. We demonstrated that BMS-754807 increased cAMP levels in PDE10A overexpressing cells and that PDE10A knockdown inhibited the effect of BMS-754807 on cAMP levels. This result indicates that BMS-754807 increases cAMP levels in a PDE10A-dependent manner. It has been reported that cAMP activates the Epac-Rap1 signaling pathway and that Rap1-dependent pathways are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells \[[@B23-ijms-21-03807]\]. In addition, it has been reported that the cAMP/Epac-Rap1 pathway is involved in chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells \[[@B24-ijms-21-03807]\

Prompt:  CPI-1205 is a drug that targets
 
Response: CPI-1205 is a drug that targets one of the key signaling pathways involved in the metastasis of prostate cancer. It has been shown that CPI-1205 downregulates expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), two proteins that are important for prostate cancer cell invasion.

The treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer with the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, bicalutamide, has significantly prolonged their survival, however, almost all patients eventually progress to a hormone-refractory state and die of their disease. It is estimated that approximately 30% of these patients will die within 2 years of starting treatment. This form of therapy is also associated with a significant decrease in the quality of life of the patient. The mechanism(s) of this disease progression is not fully understood. One of the potential mechanisms is the induction of a so-called castration-

Prompt:  CPI-444 is a drug that targets
 
Response: CPI-444 is a drug that targets the PDE10A enzyme. The PDE10A enzyme is one of four enzymes in the PDE10 subfamily of phosphodiesterases (PDE10A, PDE10B, PDE10C, and PDE10D). PDE10A is expressed in the brain and is a highly selective, high affinity inhibitor of cAMP hydrolysis (IC50 = 1.6 nM). This inhibition is responsible for the antidepressive and anxiolytic properties of the compound in preclinical models.

The most common adverse effects of CPI-444 are drowsiness, fatigue, and headaches.

Prompt:  CPI-613 is a drug that targets
 
Response: CPI-613 is a drug that targets both the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates a wide range of genes that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism and drug toxicity ([@b31-ehp0116-000110]). ARNT is an integral component of the transcriptional complex that contains AHR and mediates AHR-dependent gene regulation. Both proteins are highly conserved among species and have been identified in many tissues ([@b7-ehp0116-000110]; [@b13-ehp0116-000110]). AHR is a cytoplasmic protein that, in the absence of ligand, is constitutively bound to the chaperone protein Hsp90 ([@b26-ehp0116-000110]). When the ligand binds to the AHR,

Prompt:  Creatine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Creatine is a drug that targets creatine kinase, which is a key enzyme in energy production. Creatine is synthesized from amino acids and is present in many foods. When a person exercises, creatine is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine. This chemical is a high-energy phosphate that is used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the body's energy source. Phosphocreatine is the highest energy compound that can be formed in the body, and therefore, it is a critical component in the energy-producing process. Creatine supplementation has been used to increase exercise performance in people who are not able to meet the high energy demands of exercise.

The manufacturer of creatine supplements recommends a daily intake of 5 to 10 grams of creatine.

Creatine can also be used to increase muscle mass. It has been shown to increase muscle mass when used with weight training. The most effective dose for muscle gain is 30 to 40 grams of

Prompt:  Creatinine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Creatinine is a drug that targets the liver and kidneys and is used to test the kidney function.

Test

Samples are collected from a vein or artery in a blood sample, urine sample or saliva sample.

What is the difference between Creatinine and Creatine?

Creatinine is the metabolite of creatine and is produced in the muscles and in the kidneys.

Creatine is a high-energy compound that is stored in the muscles. Creatine is a more effective energy source than glycogen, the storage form of glucose.

Creatine is formed by the breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscle. The phosphate group is then converted into creatine. Creatine phosphate is converted to ATP in the muscles. Creatine phosphate is used in the muscle cells to store energy for muscle contraction.

Where is Creatinine located in the body?

Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism.

In the body, Creat

Prompt:  Crystal is a drug that targets
 
Response: Crystal is a drug that targets the MAPK signaling pathway in the brain, the most important component of neuro-endocrine systems that regulate metabolism and behavior. Crystal is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, and it has been shown to reduce food intake in animals, as well as reduce blood sugar in humans.

We have previously shown that in mice, crystal decreases the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that regulates the release of neurotransmitters and helps regulate energy metabolism.

Now we show that in mice, crystal increases the expression of several genes in the hypothalamus that are involved in the regulation of energy metabolism.

Crystal’s effects on energy metabolism may be mediated by changes in the brain’s release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone that increases the release of insulin and suppresses appetite.

Prompt:  Cyclosporin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Cyclosporin is a drug that targets the immune system. It is widely used in transplants. But cyclosporin also has a direct effect on the brain.

In the early 1990s, a team led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine tested the effect of cyclosporin on depression in mice. They found that it could reduce symptoms of depression in animals.

This finding was published in 1995 in the journal Brain Research.

A review of this research by two teams of researchers found the effect to be robust.

In a 2006 study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine found that the drug could reduce the risk of depression in rats.

In that study, a drug that targets the immune system called ketamine had the same effect.

The study showed that the two drugs worked by blocking a key protein called NMDA that helps neurons form connections with each other.

Response: Dalcetrapib is a drug that targets the enzyme cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). It is a CETP inhibitor that has been developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Dalcetrapib is currently being studied in combination with statins for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

CETP is a lipid transfer protein that promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG) from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins. In addition, CETP plays a role in the regulation of plasma TG concentrations by transferring TG from VLDL to HDL. The lipid transfer function of CETP is affected by genetic variation in the CETP gene.

Because the CETP protein is involved in both the uptake and transfer of lipids, CETP is an attractive drug target.

Prompt:  Danirixin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Danirixin is a drug that targets the androgen receptor (AR) to treat advanced prostate cancer (PCa). In addition to its therapeutic use, the potential to treat PCa with Danirixin, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents, has been explored. In this study, the effects of Danirixin on PCa cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were assessed. Furthermore, the effects of Danirixin on AR expression and on AR-mediated gene expression were examined. Danirixin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Danirixin increased the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase. Danirixin also decreased AR protein levels and AR-mediated gene expression. In addition, Danirixin suppressed the expression of several AR-mediated genes, including TMPRSS2, NKX

Response: Dantrolene is a drug that targets Ca^2+^-release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the contraction-relaxation cycle of striated muscle. The effects of dantrolene are thought to be due to its ability to inhibit ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and to modulate Ca^2+^ flux through this channel ([@B3]). Dantrolene, therefore, has been used in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH), and the use of this drug to treat MH has been described in the literature ([@B4]-[@B6]).

To our knowledge, there has been no report in the literature regarding the effect of dantrolene on neonatal cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of dantrolene in treating a patient with a diagnosis of MH.

Prompt:  DESOWEN is a drug that targets
 
Response: DESOWEN is a drug that targets the post-transcriptional level of gene expression. To understand the mechanism of action of DESOWEN, we performed microarray analysis to determine the effect of DESOWEN on global gene expression in three human cancer cell lines. We selected human cancer cell lines that express a high level of Ras and its downstream effector, RhoA. The most promising cell lines for DESOWEN were HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma) and PC3 (prostate cancer). Treatment with DESOWEN inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in both cell lines. Microarray analysis was performed using RNA extracted from the cell lines treated with DESOWEN for 3 days. The data were analyzed by subtracting the expression of the untreated cells from the expression of the treated cells, and were then compared with the data of the untreated cells. Among the many genes affected by DESOWEN, we selected genes that were down-regulated in all three cell lines.

Prompt:  Dihydrostreptomycin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Dihydrostreptomycin is a drug that targets the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting peptide elongation and thus the incorporation of amino acids into nascent peptides ([@r1], [@r2]). Dihydrostreptomycin also inhibits the assembly of the ribosome and thus the elongation of the ribosomal A site ([@r3]). As a consequence, bacteria that have been treated with dihydrostreptomycin die ([@r4]). The streptomycin-binding site of the 50S subunit is buried in the bacterial ribosome and is formed by 23S rRNA helixes H41 and H44 ([@r5]). Streptomycin binds to this site with a dissociation constant of approximately 5 μM ([@r6], [@r7]). Dihydrostreptomycin has a higher affinity for the streptomycin

Prompt:  Dimethylamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Dimethylamine is a drug that targets the H3 receptor. This was first reported by Lovenberg and colleagues \[[@B1-pharmaceuticals-13-00138]\]. The mechanism of action of dimethylamine is not completely understood, but a model has been proposed in which dimethylamine is released from the intestine into the bloodstream, crosses the blood--brain barrier, and then binds to the H3 receptor. This leads to a decrease in brain acetylcholine levels. A decrease in acetylcholine causes a reduction in cognitive functions \[[@B1-pharmaceuticals-13-00138]\].

Dimethylamine has a very long half-life in the bloodstream and is not metabolized by the liver. Thus, it is easily detectable in the urine and can be used to monitor drug intake. It has been shown that patients with cirrhosis have an increased level of dimethylamine in

Prompt:  Domperidone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Domperidone is a drug that targets the dopamine D2 receptors and has been approved by the FDA to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It has also been studied as a possible treatment for schizophrenia, with early studies showing some efficacy in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In 2006, the FDA granted approval to the use of domperidone for schizophrenia.

Some domperidone is excreted by the kidneys, but much of it is metabolized by the liver, so it can cause elevated liver enzymes in some patients.

Domperidone has been associated with significant elevations of liver enzymes in patients, with some reports of fatal liver failure, and the US Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers to include warnings about liver toxicity.

While some studies suggest that domperidone is an effective treatment for some patients with schizophrenia, domperidone has not been shown to be superior to other antipsychotics.

Prompt:  Dopamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Dopamine is a drug that targets the central nervous system. It is well known that dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is associated with the reinforcement of the addiction to addictive substances such as alcohol, nicotine, and drugs. There is no established treatment for addictive substance dependence, and dopamine is currently used as a treatment for cocaine dependence. In addition, dopamine is known to be a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. It is expected that further development of dopamine as a therapeutic agent for addiction will lead to the development of therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and depression.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released by dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra of the midbrain and binds to dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of neurons. Dopamine is known to regulate various physiological functions, including motor functions, endocrine functions, and psychiatric functions, and dopamine receptors have been identified as G-protein-coupled receptors.

Prompt:  Eloxatin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Eloxatin is a drug that targets telomerase.

I had no idea how much of a headache the drug was until I started reading about it on the internet.

Here are the top five problems with eloxatin:

1. It doesn’t work

A recent study showed that eloxatin didn’t work.

Researchers at the National Cancer Institute and University of California, San Diego, found that telomerase is not active in most tumors.

“Our data do not support the hypothesis that telomerase inhibition would be an effective anticancer therapy in a broad range of cancers,” they wrote.

2. It’s a chemotherapy drug

It’s not cancer treatment. It’s chemotherapy.

The American Cancer Society says that chemotherapy can’t cure cancer. It’s only designed to slow down the growth of cancer cells.

Prompt:  Emricasan is a drug that targets
 
Response: Emricasan is a drug that targets a membrane receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate. In the central nervous system, glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, and is involved in a wide range of physiological processes. The sub-type of glutamate receptor to which Emricasan binds is the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, which is present in high concentrations in the synapses between neurons. It is activated when glutamate binds to the receptor, and this binding is blocked by Emricasan.
Emricasan has been shown to be a very effective treatment for the mouse model of Huntington's disease, and it has been suggested that it may also be effective in treating human patients with Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is an inherited condition in which the body's cells become damaged and die over time. In this condition, the patients suffer from a combination of physical symptoms

Prompt:  Epinephrine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Epinephrine is a drug that targets the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is an important modulator of the cardiovascular system, and one of the most important regulators of blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure occurs when sympathetic activity is stimulated, and conversely, decreases in blood pressure occur when sympathetic activity is inhibited. Epinephrine is a potent sympathetic stimulator and, in the presence of epinephrine, blood pressure typically increases.
In addition to blood pressure, epinephrine is also known to stimulate heart rate. Epinephrine is a key component of the “fight or flight” response, and its effects are mediated by adrenergic receptors in the SNS. There are two subtypes of adrenergic receptors in the SNS: α- and β-adrenergic receptors. These adrenergic receptors respond to the binding of epinephrine and norepinephrine by activating adenylate cyclase and generating cyclic adenosine monophosph

Response: EPIVIR is a drug that targets hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is a potent inhibitor of HCV replication, which has been approved for use in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We have shown that the viral resistance-associated mutations to telaprevir (TPV) and TPV/RBV combination therapy occur at similar frequencies and are associated with decreased clinical response. Furthermore, we have shown that resistance-associated mutations to TPV/RBV therapy are associated with a high rate of relapse after cessation of treatment.

In the current study, we report the virologic and clinical outcomes in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who received triple therapy with TPV, RBV, and pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for 24 weeks (PEG-IFN/RBV/TPV). In our

Response: Eprosartan is a drug that targets angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) and has been reported to be effective in preventing vascular diseases and hypertension ([@B1]). However, there are few reports regarding the effects of eprosartan on platelet function.

Platelets play a central role in vascular homeostasis by participating in the formation of thrombi and in hemostasis. Platelets are highly responsive to environmental stimuli such as agonists, and this responsiveness can be assessed by measuring platelet aggregation ([@B2]). Platelet function is affected by various diseases and drugs ([@B3]), and platelet dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease ([@B4]) and peripheral artery disease ([@B5]). In addition, there is a positive association between the risk of myocardial infarction and a decrease in platelet aggregation ([@B

Prompt:  Equol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Equol is a drug that targets estrogen receptors and that can be used to treat hormone-related conditions, including some types of breast cancer.

This can be a tricky question to answer.

First, we need to understand the type of breast cancer.

There are two types of breast cancer:

Invasive breast cancer. This type of cancer can grow inside the breast and into the surrounding tissue.

Invasive breast cancer. This type of cancer can grow inside the breast and into the surrounding tissue. Noninvasive breast cancer. This type of cancer does not invade the surrounding tissue.

If you have invasive breast cancer, the term you want to use is “breast cancer.” If you have noninvasive breast cancer, the term you want to use is “breast cancer.”

Prompt:  Equol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Equol is a drug that targets the body’s production of estrogen. By reducing the amount of estrogen in your body, you can prevent the effects of estrogen from growing hair in your face. Some women may be concerned that taking estrogen-like drugs will cause hair growth, but this isn’t the case. There is no need to worry about side effects, as long as you take your medication correctly. If you do have any concerns about the safety of the drug, talk to your doctor about alternative ways to treat your hair loss.

Women often lose hair in the front and top of the head. There are many reasons for this, including the menopause and chemotherapy treatments. The main reason for the hair loss, however, is that the hormone estrogen plays a major role in hair growth. The body naturally produces more estrogen when a woman is pregnant, and it also makes estrogen after menopause.

Women can also lose hair on their legs and underarms,

Prompt:  Erdosteine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Erdosteine is a drug that targets a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). It is a synthetic analog of ubiquinone, which is an important part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This chain transports electrons from the mitochondrial matrix to the electron transport chain, where they are used to create energy. The energy produced is then converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of energy in the cell.

Erdosteine is used to treat a variety of conditions. This includes pain associated with osteoarthritis, nerve pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. It is also used to treat mitochondrial diseases and prevent migraine headaches.

The FDA has approved erdosteine for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders and the prevention of migraine headaches. However, it is not FDA-approved for any other uses.

Response: Ergoloid is a drug that targets protein-protein interactions in the process of bacterial translation. Ergoloid is currently being developed by Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as a potential treatment for tuberculosis and certain types of cancer. It is also in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

Ergoloid inhibits translation of proteins that are necessary for the cell to multiply.  Ergoloid binds to the ribosome of the cell, and disrupts the formation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) on the ribosome. The PTC is responsible for the addition of the amino acid onto the growing peptide chain, and the inhibition of this process results in the inhibition of cell growth.

Prompt:  Erythritol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Erythritol is a drug that targets a cellular process unique to cancer cells and causes them to die. It works by forcing the cancer cells to produce excess amounts of a protein called hexokinase 2. Cancer cells are normally dependent on glucose for energy and cannot make enough of this protein to sustain themselves.

In order to maintain energy production, they must get their energy from outside sources, which include sugars. When erythritol blocks the uptake of these sugars, cancer cells can no longer maintain their energy production and they begin to die.

Erythritol is used in a number of food and cosmetic products, including diet products, chocolate, cookies, gum, and even cosmetics such as lipsticks.

Since it is naturally occurring, erythritol does not require FDA approval. However, it is generally recognized as safe and non-toxic.

Prompt:  erythromycin is a drug that targets
 
Response: erythromycin is a drug that targets ribosomes, and that is also a potent antibiotic against tuberculosis. However, it is not used for treatment of anthrax, due to its narrow spectrum of activity. The development of macrolides as therapeutic agents for anthrax was complicated by the discovery that a few macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) inhibit the growth of certain bacteria. These observations led to the hypothesis that macrolides have broader-spectrum activity against bacterial pathogens than originally thought. This hypothesis was borne out when azithromycin was shown to be effective in mouse models of inhalational anthrax. However, the mouse model of inhalational anthrax is much more severe than the disease in humans, and the potential use of macrolides in the treatment of anthrax is unclear.
Recently, the crystal structure of the ribosome of Bacillus anthracis was determined, and it was found that the macrolide binding site is located

Response: ethoxzolamide is a drug that targets the pigment cells and is used in combination with atropine to treat myopia. It is effective for treating myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. It is also used to treat uveitis.

There are three mechanisms by which atropine may slow myopia progression. Atropine is a cholinergic agonist that acts as a parasympatholytic. It increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing the activity of the accommodation reflex. The accommodation reflex is the mechanism by which the eye can adjust to blur of the image. The accommodation reflex involves the interaction of the iris and ciliary body muscles with the zonular apparatus. The cholinergic action of atropine increases the thickness of the ciliary body. The ciliary body responds to the increase in thickness by dilating the pupil. The iris responds to the dilated

Prompt:  Etoposide is a drug that targets
 
Response: Etoposide is a drug that targets the enzymes topoisomerase II (TOP2) and topoisomerase I (TOP1). Etoposide is a synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of a variety of malignancies. The drug was originally discovered as a TOP2 poison, and its efficacy was later discovered to be related to its TOP1 poison properties. TOP2 poisons are widely used in chemotherapy because of their effectiveness against cancer cells. TOP1 poisons are useful for their ability to stabilize TOP1 cleavable complexes and thereby inhibit DNA replication. Because of the role of TOP2 and TOP1 in the cell cycle, they are both cytotoxic. This is why TOP2 and TOP1 are important targets for chemotherapy.

Prompt:  etravirine is a drug that targets
 
Response: etravirine is a drug that targets the integrase of HIV. It is one of the most popular drug for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The two inhibitors, nevirapine and efavirenz, are the first two of this class of drugs that were approved by the FDA in 1998. Nevirapine and efavirenz are potent and effective drugs in treating HIV-infected patients, but their long-term safety has not been determined. Therefore, they have been considered as drugs with a high potential for adverse drug reactions. The reason for this is that they are highly lipophilic, so that their metabolism is very slow and their elimination from the body is prolonged. As a result, they may accumulate in tissues and may cause long-term adverse reactions. One such adverse reaction is hepatotoxicity.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the use of nevirapine and efavirenz in the treatment of HIV/AIDS

Response: Fenchone is a drug that targets the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R) to induce analgesia. In contrast to other muscarinic receptor agonists, fenchone has an analgesic effect that is independent of its ability to stimulate M1R. We have previously shown that the analgesic effect of fenchone is mediated by 5-HT3 receptor activation and inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels. We now demonstrate that fenchone can inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels and enhance Ca2+ currents through T-type Ca2+ channels. In addition, fenchone inhibits N-type Ca2+ channels with an EC50 of 10 μM and blocks K+ currents through these channels with an EC50 of 20 μM.

Response: Fenofibric is a drug that targets the synthesis of the molecule Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the liver. FXR is a bile acid receptor, which is a nuclear hormone receptor. The bile acids that bind to FXR are known as bile acids. When FXR is activated, it binds to its natural ligands, bile acids. It then binds to nuclear hormone response elements in the promoters of genes that it regulates. FXR, as well as its binding partners, regulate the expression of genes that control the lipid and cholesterol metabolism.

FXR was discovered in 1998. The name of the FXR gene is “farnesoid X receptor.” FXR has been found to be expressed in various tissues and organs. FXR is present in the small intestine, the liver, the gall bladder, the kidney, the pancreas, the adrenal glands, the spleen, the colon, the lung, the

Prompt:  Floxuridine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Floxuridine is a drug that targets cancer cells by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS), which is essential for the de novo synthesis of thymidylate. Floxuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) is the active metabolite of floxuridine, which inhibits TS by binding to the active site of the enzyme. Since TS is present in all rapidly dividing cells, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, this drug can have serious side effects, such as myelosuppression, that may limit its usefulness.
The use of floxuridine to treat certain cancers has been limited by its short plasma half-life. Therefore, it has been necessary to administer floxuridine by infusion, requiring frequent blood sampling to determine the proper dose of the drug. Thus, the need exists for an improved floxuridine compound that can be administered orally and that has a longer plasma half-life than floxuridine.

Prompt:  Fluorometholone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Fluorometholone is a drug that targets the ocular surface by inhibiting the action of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which catalyzes the conversion of cortisone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC). Fluorometholone is the most widely used corticosteroid for ophthalmic indications, and its efficacy in reducing intraocular inflammation has been established in multiple clinical studies.\[[@ref1][@ref2]\] Despite its wide use, the safety of fluorometholone has been a matter of concern, particularly in patients with chronic systemic diseases. Several case reports of ocular fluorometholone toxicity have been published, and in a few cases, such toxicity was associated with the development of a wide range of systemic complications, including liver and kidney injury.\[[@ref3][@ref4][@ref5][@ref6]

Prompt:  Fluoxetine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Fluoxetine is a drug that targets the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) and thereby increases the availability of serotonin at synapses. This drug has been used for decades to treat depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the last two decades, the drug has been found to be useful in the treatment of other conditions, such as eating disorders, anxiety, and substance abuse. The pharmacological action of fluoxetine in depression is still poorly understood, but it is generally thought to be mediated by two different mechanisms: the enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and the activation of a 5-HT1A autoreceptor. These two mechanisms are supposed to be responsible for the antidepressant effect of the drug.^[@ref1]^ However, the treatment of patients with OCD with fluoxetine has not yielded satisfactory results, and it has been found that the drug is unable to treat more than 70%

Prompt:  Fluphenazine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Fluphenazine is a drug that targets dopamine receptors and has long been used in the treatment of schizophrenia. There are two types of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2. They have different functions in the brain and there are different receptors for each type. In the 1990’s the drug was modified so that it could target only D2 receptors and this became known as atypical antipsychotic. The benefits of these drugs over typical antipsychotics were much better control of the disease symptoms and they were much less likely to cause extra movement problems.

In the late 1990’s the problem of extra movement problems was discovered. It was found that these drugs had a large number of side effects and one of the most common was weight gain. In fact it was found that most of the drugs that target the D2 receptors cause weight gain. This weight gain is often accompanied by increased appetite and it was also found that the drugs often caused other problems like diabetes and high blood

Prompt:  Flupirtine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Flupirtine is a drug that targets sodium channels and may be used for pain relief. We studied the effects of this drug on behavior in mice using an open field test. The drug had no effect on spontaneous activity, but when given with apomorphine (APO), it increased the number of rearing movements. Apomorphine has been shown to induce a psychosis-like state in animals and in humans. This study shows that flupirtine is capable of increasing the locomotor response to APO. We suggest that the combination of flupirtine and APO may be used as a model of the effects of neuroleptics on the psychotic state.

To determine the role of adenosine in mediating the behavioral effects of flupirtine, a non-selective adenosine antagonist, caffeine, was used. The mice were treated with flupirtine (0.5-2.5 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.

Response: Fluvoxamine is a drug that targets serotonin reuptake into presynaptic neurons. Its action results in decreased neurotransmitter reuptake and subsequent increases in synaptic serotonin concentrations. This action results in a therapeutic effect of fluvoxamine on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). However, fluvoxamine has the potential to cause sexual dysfunction, and this side effect may be more common in women than in men. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 30 patients with OCD, 20 mg of fluvoxamine daily for 12 weeks resulted in decreased libido in women, but not in men. There were no other side effects. The authors concluded that fluvoxamine is an effective treatment for OCD, but should be used cautiously in women. [Reference: Holub, M. A., et al.

Response: Fosinopril is a drug that targets the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Its effects are well known, but they are of limited value in treating arterial hypertension (AH). One reason for this is that fosinopril inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (AT II), the effector of the RAAS. AT II is a potent vasoconstrictor. Another reason is that, in spite of its ability to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to AT II, fosinopril has a low efficacy in inhibiting the production of aldosterone. A further reason is that fosinopril does not inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that is located in the lung and that is responsible for the degradation of bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide.

Response: Fructose is a drug that targets a receptor in the brain called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). When AMPK is activated, it stimulates the production of glucose from the breakdown of fat.

In the brain, this creates an energy imbalance. That’s why people who drink sugar are constantly hungry.

“When we started doing the studies, I was told, ‘If you do a sugar study, you’re going to get cancer,'” said Dr. Jeffrey S. M. Lockwood, an endocrinologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom who led the study. “We did it and found out that’s not true.”

Prompt:  Ftorafur is a drug that targets
 
Response: Ftorafur is a drug that targets the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) and blocks the formation of the active metabolite, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), thus preventing its incorporation into DNA and ultimately resulting in apoptosis. In the presence of 5-FU, TS is inhibited and the enzyme cannot form the active metabolite. The reaction proceeds without the enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of a toxic metabolite.

The chemotherapeutic effect of 5-FU is mediated by its conversion to the fluoropyrimidine 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate (FdUMP), which incorporates into DNA and inhibits thymidylate synthase. By inhibiting the formation of the active metabolite, 5-FU is an effective inhibitor of TS. This inhibition results in a loss of the TS function, which ultimately leads to cell death.[@b1-asm-5-392

Prompt:  Gallamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Gallamine is a drug that targets the noradrenergic system, and is used in psychiatry for the treatment of depression. A single oral dose of the drug has been reported to increase the binding of \[^123^I\]IBZM to the β~1~-adrenergic receptor (AR) in rat cortex ([@bib6]). Although the increase in binding is modest, the potential clinical implications of this finding are substantial. β~1~-AR is an established target for the treatment of depression, and an increase in its density in cortical areas that receive dense noradrenergic innervation, such as the prefrontal cortex, may indicate an enhanced efficacy of drugs that target this receptor. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of prolonged administration of imipramine, a standard antidepressant drug, on the \[^123^I\]IBZM binding to the β~1~-AR in rat cortex.

Response: Genistein is a drug that targets the estrogen receptor and is widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. In our recent study, we investigated the effect of genistein on the tumor-suppressive miRNAs in breast cancer cells, and demonstrated that miR-9 and miR-124 are increased by genistein treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genistein increases the level of DNMT3A by repressing miR-9 and miR-124, leading to the increase of DNA methylation. Thus, genistein increases DNA methylation in breast cancer cells. In contrast, in normal cells, genistein decreased the level of DNMT3A and DNA methylation. Therefore, the miR-9 and miR-124 that are induced by genistein in breast cancer cells are important for the increase of DNA methylation, and can be used as markers for genistein treatment in breast cancer cells.

Prompt:  GSK1349572 is a drug that targets
 
Response: GSK1349572 is a drug that targets PDE10, a phosphodiesterase involved in the hydrolysis of cGMP. cGMP is a second messenger in the body. In the brain, it mediates the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine. When cGMP is elevated, it binds to and opens the NMDA receptor, causing an influx of calcium. By inhibiting PDE10, it causes more cGMP to remain bound to the NMDA receptor, which increases the number of channels open. This increase in calcium leads to an increase in synaptic strength and cell growth. It is currently being tested for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease.

PDE10 is a phosphodiesterase enzyme. It is located in the brain and is involved in the regulation of cGMP and calcium. PDE10 is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,

Prompt:  GSK525762 is a drug that targets
 
Response: GSK525762 is a drug that targets the VEGFR2 and ErbB3 receptors. It has a similar structure to the drug Sunitinib, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. It has been approved in Japan for use in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). It is used in combination with chemotherapy.

A Phase I trial was conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute in 2005, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK525762 in patients with advanced solid tumours. It found that the MTD was 10 mg/kg, with dose-limiting toxicities of hypertension, proteinuria and fatigue. A Phase II trial in 2006–2007, with 40 patients with advanced solid tumours, investigated the safety and efficacy of GSK525762 in combination with standard chemotherapy. This found that the drug was generally well tolerated, and that it may be useful as an anti-ang

Prompt:  Guanabenz is a drug that targets
 
Response: Guanabenz is a drug that targets the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to reduce blood pressure. The drug is the most commonly used antihypertensive agent in Japan and has been shown to be efficacious in various clinical studies, but its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. The renin-angiotensin system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure, and the role of angiotensin II in the regulation of vascular resistance and vascular remodeling is well known. A number of studies have shown that the activation of the RAS promotes a number of cellular responses that are involved in vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis, including vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Because RAS inhibitors are widely used as antihypertensive drugs, it is important to investigate the pathophysiological role of the RAS in cardiovascular disease.

Prompt:  HEPSERA is a drug that targets
 
Response: HEPSERA is a drug that targets hepsin, an important protease that is over-expressed in some cancer cells. Hepsin is a serine protease, but it also possesses a chymotrypsin-like domain that is active in the presence of Zn^2+^ ions. This domain is able to cleave off the hydrophobic heptapeptide loop that holds the cysteine protease domain in a folded state. This cleavage is essential for the activation of the cysteine protease domain.^[@ref9]^ Therefore, the chymotrypsin-like domain is the drug target, and hepsin inhibition by HPSERA results in the unfolding of the protein, which ultimately leads to its degradation.^[@ref8]^ HPSERA has a relatively short half-life in plasma and a short systemic exposure time in mice and rats.^[@ref8]^

Prompt:  Hexestrol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Hexestrol is a drug that targets estrogen receptors and can be used for the treatment of many gynecological conditions such as endometriosis, infertility, and breast cancer. Due to the adverse side effects of the drug, such as deep vein thrombosis, it is being withdrawn from the market. This is because of the presence of unknown contaminants, including estrogenic impurities in the drug. The major concern with the presence of these estrogenic impurities is the risk of cancer. As such, we aimed to investigate the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of these side effects. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of hexestrol on lipid peroxidation and antioxidants in mice. The mice were injected with hexestrol (10 mg/kg body weight) for 21 days.

Prompt:  HMN-214 is a drug that targets
 
Response: HMN-214 is a drug that targets the TGF-β pathway, with the primary purpose of being a treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). TGF-β is a cytokine with multiple functions that play a critical role in cancer progression. TGF-β inhibits proliferation of the myeloma cells, suppresses the production of IL-6 and other cytokines that stimulate tumor growth, and promotes the production of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix and promote tumor cell migration and invasion.

Unfortunately, the development of TGF-β pathway inhibitors has been hindered by lack of specificity, resulting in significant toxicity in normal tissues. In addition, resistance to TGF-β inhibitors has been observed in multiple myeloma cells.

TGM-HMN-214 is a highly specific inhibitor of TGF-βRI kinase, a TGF-β signaling mediator that activates the transcription of genes regulated by Smad proteins.

Prompt:  Hydroxyurea is a drug that targets
 
Response: Hydroxyurea is a drug that targets cancer cells by selectively inducing apoptosis. It was originally developed for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, but it has since been approved for use in several other diseases including myeloproliferative disorders and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The active metabolite of hydroxyurea is hydroxyurea diphosphate (HUDP).

Mechanism of Action {#s1}
===================

Hydroxyurea acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. RNR is composed of a large subunit (RRM1) and a small subunit (RRM2) \[[@R1]\]. Hydroxyurea has a unique mechanism of action in that it inhibits both subunits of RNR \[[@R2]\].

Prompt:  Hygromycin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Hygromycin is a drug that targets the translation process and stops protein synthesis, which is used as a fungicide and an antibiotic. Hygromycin is often used to treat E. coli and other bacteria that cause food poisoning. Hygromycin can also be used to prevent the growth of fungi that cause diseases such as Candida, Pseudomonas, and Cryptococcus. The process of hygromycin's production begins with the production of two aminoglycoside nucleotides, which are then combined to make hygromycin. The final product is made when a phosphotransferase enzyme (PTS) adds phosphate to the final product.

1. Process Overview

In the hygromycin process, two aminoglycoside nucleotides are combined to form hygromycin. These nucleotides are combined using a process called aminoglycoside nucleotidespecific enzyme kinetics. Aminoglycos

Prompt:  Indirubin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Indirubin is a drug that targets multiple tumor-specific signaling pathways. This study was designed to investigate the effects of combining topotecan and indirubin on the in vitro proliferation and migration of human colon cancer cells. We also investigated the potential mechanisms involved. The combination of topotecan and indirubin showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation and migration of the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line. Indirubin significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of topotecan in vitro. In addition, indirubin suppressed cell migration through upregulation of TIMP-1 expression, which is induced by topotecan. Indirubin enhanced the antitumor effects of topotecan through the induction of TIMP-1 expression in human colon cancer cells. Our findings suggest that indirubin could be a promising candidate for use in combination with topotecan for treatment of colon cancer.

Prompt:  Isocarboxazid is a drug that targets
 
Response: Isocarboxazid is a drug that targets MAO-A.

Molecular structure
Isocarboxazid is a member of a group of related drugs known as the MAO-A inhibitors.  Isocarboxazid differs from other MAO-A inhibitors by having a keto-enol functionality.  This keto-enol functionality is responsible for the increased metabolic stability of isocarboxazid.  Isocarboxazid is not metabolized in the liver.

Mechanism of action
Isocarboxazid is a monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitor.  MAO-A is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter serotonin.  Isocarboxazid inhibits MAO-A by competing with the substrate, 5-HT, and irreversibly binds to the enzyme.  This binding causes the enzyme to be unable to break

Prompt:  Isotretinoin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Isotretinoin is a drug that targets the enzyme 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) and inhibits the synthesis of RA. Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne for over 30 years. It is also used to treat severe cystic acne in patients who have not responded to conventional therapy. The efficacy of isotretinoin is attributed to its ability to induce a comedone-free, non-scarring response in acne lesions.

Mechanism of Action

Isotretinoin binds to and inhibits the enzyme 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) oxidase, which is required for the conversion of all-trans retinoic acid to 13-cis retinoic acid. This results in a decrease in the levels of 13-cis RA in the skin.

Reduction in the levels of 13-cis RA leads to decreased production of sebum and thus fewer comedones.

Response: JNJ-42756493 is a drug that targets the Notch pathway and may offer a new way to treat cancer.

But first, they need to get FDA approval. And that is proving to be a huge challenge.

On April 24, 2019, the FDA announced that it would be requiring that any new drug for cancer treatment that targets the Notch pathway also undergo a clinical trial.

In a press release from the FDA, the agency said that the Notch pathway “plays a role in a wide variety of cancers, and drugs that inhibit Notch are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treatment of a range of cancers.”

Specifically, the FDA said that drugs targeting the Notch pathway are being tested for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Prompt:  Lapachone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Lapachone is a drug that targets mitochondria, a key organelle responsible for producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This important energy source is needed for the body to function and is required for the cell to divide and grow. In healthy cells, the process of making energy is regulated by the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria. The electron transport chain is the series of protein complexes that help move electrons along a chain of molecules until they are passed to oxygen to form water. The electron transport chain can be blocked by molecules that interfere with the movement of electrons. In this case, energy production in the mitochondria is impaired, resulting in decreased ATP production. This causes an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to cellular damage and death.\[[@ref1]\]

When mitochondria are damaged, their ability to produce energy is compromised, and this can result in oxidative stress. This

Response: L-Arginine is a drug that targets arginase, an enzyme that plays a role in immune system modulation. By inhibiting arginase, L-Arginine causes an increase in nitric oxide, a chemical that is important for immune system function. In this case, L-Arginine is used in combination with an immune stimulant called polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid or Poly I:C.

It is a very powerful drug that can be taken by mouth, by injection, or rectally. L-Arginine is sold as an injectable under the name Argin-8.

The combination of L-Arginine and Poly I:C is called Argin-8 Plus. Argin-8 Plus is a combination of Argin-8 and Poly I:C. It is made by Inviragen.

Prompt:  Lasmiditan is a drug that targets
 
Response: Lasmiditan is a drug that targets the T-cell receptors and may offer a new and improved treatment for migraine. It is now in Phase III trials.

So far, lasmiditan is not on the market, but is it safe? The FDA recently issued a warning that lasmiditan should not be taken by people with coronary artery disease, as it may cause cardiovascular problems. This is a rare side effect and has only been seen in a few people, but it is a risk worth considering.

“There are risks and benefits to any new drug,” says Scott Lathrop, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Washington in Seattle. “But the benefits for migraine are large.”

Researchers have known for decades that the T-cell receptor, a protein on the surface of the T-cell, is crucial for the immune system to function. The receptor recognizes antigens, which are foreign proteins that

Prompt:  Leuprorelin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Leuprorelin is a drug that targets the androgen receptor and is used for treating hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Although leuprorelin has proven to be effective in controlling disease progression, it has been reported to cause numerous side effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido, and vaginal dryness. Because of these side effects, many patients discontinue treatment. Therefore, new leuprorelin formulations that can minimize the occurrence of side effects and that can be administered at a lower dose than the conventional leuprorelin formulations would be desirable.
Leuprorelin is an analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that is a decapeptide consisting of 10 amino acids. In general, GnRH analogs that are highly potent and selective for the GnRH receptor can be used to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Response: levalbuterol is a drug that targets beta-2 receptors in the lungs. These are the same receptors that are affected by Albuterol. It is very similar to Albuterol in that it is a drug that has been around for years. However, it has some very important differences from Albuterol.

Unlike Albuterol, Terbutaline is not a short-acting bronchodilator. It is actually a long-acting bronchodilator.

Another important difference between Albuterol and Terbutaline is that the use of Albuterol is FDA approved for the treatment of asthma. Terbutaline is not FDA approved for the treatment of asthma.

The most important difference between the two drugs is that Terbutaline has a much longer half-life than Albuterol.

Prompt:  LGK-974 is a drug that targets
 
Response: LGK-974 is a drug that targets an enzyme called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a transmembrane receptor that binds to epidermal growth factor (EGF). When bound to EGF, EGFR activates many other receptors, cell signaling pathways, and processes that regulate cell growth and proliferation. EGFR is found in many different cell types and is a target for treatment of a number of cancers. In lung cancer, EGFR is mutated in approximately half of all patients, and in these patients, the EGFR mutation leads to the constitutive activation of EGFR. In these patients, EGFR is the most commonly mutated oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer.

I am writing this blog because I have been working with LGK-974 as a potential treatment for NSCLC patients with the EGFR mutation. The trial is going to be presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June. In addition to being

Prompt:  Lincomycin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Lincomycin is a drug that targets an enzyme called enolase, which is found in all living cells. It’s been shown to have anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-cancer properties. Lincomycin is most commonly used to treat Lyme disease, a bacterial infection that is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Lyme disease affects nearly 10,000 people in the U.S. each year.

Lincomycin works by preventing the cell’s metabolism from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The loss of ATP affects the cell’s ability to repair itself, resulting in the death of the infected cell.

While this may seem like a frightening drug to use, the problem is that this drug is also known to be one of the most toxic antibiotics on the market.

Conclusions
===========

Fatty acid metabolism in HIV-infected patients is altered by chronic viral infection and co-infection with HCV and HBV. In this review, we have summarized evidence of a role for these changes in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. These abnormalities are not the only abnormalities of lipid metabolism in HIV-infected patients and will be discussed in future reviews. A better understanding of the role of lipid metabolism in HIV-infected patients may lead to new therapies for these conditions.

Prompt:  LM-3572 is a drug that targets
 
Response: LM-3572 is a drug that targets the dopamine D2 receptor, the exact mechanism of which is not well understood. The use of amphetamine is one method for stimulating the release of dopamine. Amphetamine is a powerful central nervous system stimulant, the action of which is mediated by the stimulation of dopamine receptors. It is believed that amphetamine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, thereby increasing the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. The release of dopamine from nerve terminals in the brain stimulates a number of different neurotransmitters, resulting in increased levels of attention, motor activity, appetite, and well being.
Dopamine antagonists, on the other hand, inhibit the release of dopamine and/or the binding of dopamine to dopamine receptors. The most commonly prescribed antagonists are the dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, e.g., metoclopramide, sulpiride, and haloperidol.

Prompt:  LM-3632 is a drug that targets
 
Response: LM-3632 is a drug that targets the NF-κB pathway and can induce cell death in cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that the combination of Doxorubicin and ML-3632 significantly increased apoptosis and necrosis in the MCF-7/Dox breast cancer cells, compared to the single agents alone. This combination also induced the accumulation of ROS and G2/M cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7/Dox cells. Moreover, the ML-3632 combination significantly suppressed the growth of MCF-7/Dox xenograft tumors in nude mice. In addition, the combination of Dox and ML-3632 significantly suppressed the expression of p-STAT3 and c-FLIP, which are two anti-apoptotic proteins. Our results suggested that the combination of Dox and ML-3632 may have the potential to improve the treatment of breast cancer.

Response: LOZOL is a drug that targets macrophages and microglia and has been studied as a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LOZOL on phagocytosis in an in vitro model of microglia and to determine whether these effects are mediated via inhibition of MAPK signaling. Microglia were treated with LOZOL and subsequently exposed to apoptotic cells. Phagocytosis was determined using confocal microscopy. Cell lysates were analyzed for activation of the MAPKs ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. Phagocytosis was inhibited in LOZOL-treated microglia. Furthermore, LOZOL inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in response to apoptotic cells. Inhibition of MAPK signaling is associated with reduced phagocytosis, and this effect is likely mediated by inhibition of

Prompt:  L-Threonine is a drug that targets
 
Response: L-Threonine is a drug that targets bacterial threonine deaminase (TD). TD is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of L-threonine to L-homoserine. The gene encoding TD is usually present as a single copy, but the presence of multiple copies has been reported in some species of bacteria. In some Gram-positive bacteria, multiple TD genes have been found to be clustered in a single operon, suggesting that they may be regulated by the same mechanism \[[@B1]\]. In Gram-negative bacteria, the TD genes are usually clustered in two operons \[[@B2]\].

Prompt:  Lu is a drug that targets
 
Response: Lu is a drug that targets DNA methylation in leukemia. The effect of this drug on DNA methylation is known to be mediated by an effect on DNMT1. The exact mechanism of this effect has not been completely elucidated. It has been shown that AML1a binds to DNMT1 in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, AML1a recruits DNMT1 to the promoter of the CDKN1A gene. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the effect of AML1a on DNA methylation may be through the recruitment of DNMT1 to the CDKN1A promoter. However, other studies have shown that AML1a has no effect on the DNA methylation status of the CDKN1A promoter. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of AML1a on the DNA methylation status of the CDKN1A promoter in the AML1-ETO transgenic mouse model. The data show that the

Prompt:  LY is a drug that targets
 
Response: LY is a drug that targets a cellular mechanism of fibrosis. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the effect of IL-6 inhibition on EPR in patients with SSc. It has been suggested that EPR can be suppressed by administration of an IL-6 receptor antagonist.[@b14-btt-8-091] Therefore, we administered tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, to an SSc patient with progressive EPR and RA who had active skin lesions and symptoms. The results suggested that the administration of tocilizumab may be a new treatment for SSc patients with EPR.

The major limitation of our report is the small number of patients. Although this report suggested that tocilizumab may be effective for EPR in patients with SSc, further studies are needed to validate this result.

Prompt:  LY2784544 is a drug that targets
 
Response: LY2784544 is a drug that targets the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor and the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor, and has been shown to induce both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that is important for memory. The study by Rosen et al. (2013) found that memantine may be effective for treating both schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. A pilot study found that memantine improves verbal learning and memory in people with schizophrenia (Haggarty et al., 2007). However, the study also found that memantine caused adverse effects in some patients, including increased anxiety, hostility and suicidality. In addition, memantine is not suitable for use in children. Thus, memantine is not a preferred drug for treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
As such, there remains a need for an effective treatment for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Prompt:  LY2801653 is a drug that targets
 
Response: LY2801653 is a drug that targets cell surface proteins that are found in patients with certain types of cancer. It works by disrupting a cell’s ability to move. A team of researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center used this drug in conjunction with radiation to treat advanced prostate cancer patients. It showed that it was possible to use a drug that targets cell surface proteins in conjunction with radiation to effectively target cancer cells.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in men overall. It’s also the second leading cause of cancer death in men.

The treatment protocol involves combining the drug with radiation to target the cancer cells. The radiation, known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses a focused beam of radiation to kill the cancer cells. The combination of the two treatments works to both destroy the cancer cells and slow their ability to multiply.

The oral 5-FU prodrug capecitabine, which is used to treat colon cancer, is a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor and a thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inhibitor. Therefore, it exerts its anticancer activity by inhibition of both TS and TP and through its metabolites. However, 5-FU can be degraded by cytidine deaminase, resulting in decreased anticancer activity. Therefore, capecitabine and its metabolites are conjugated to an active carrier to prevent degradation

Response: LY2874455 is a drug that targets the ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase. A variety of preclinical studies have shown that this drug can reduce the growth of various types of cancer in mice. However, a phase III clinical trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed no overall survival advantage with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy, and this drug is no longer approved for the treatment of NSCLC. Despite these disappointing results, the drug has shown significant clinical activity in a subset of patients with breast cancer, and in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

However, recent studies have suggested that HER3 is a key mediator of the biological effects of HER2 and the drug is now approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab.

Introduction

Cancer is a major health problem worldwide, causing an estimated 8.2 million deaths in 2015 (WHO, 2015). Brain tumours are the most common primary brain neoplasm in adults (World Health Organization, 2015). Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival for patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) is approximately 12 months (Chiang et al., 2007

Prompt:  Malachite is a drug that targets
 
Response: Malachite is a drug that targets lysosomes, where it causes the accumulation of the autophagic vacuole. When an organelle like a lysosome is full of undigested material, it fuses with a vacuole containing proteolytic enzymes called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes engulf the contents of the lysosome and fuse with lysosomes, releasing their contents into the cytoplasm. Then the autophagosomes break down to release their contents into the cytoplasm, and eventually the lysosome re-fuses with an autophagosome.

Prompt:  Malotilate is a drug that targets
 
Response: Malotilate is a drug that targets Bcl-2, a protein that helps keep cells alive. In the case of malotilate, it targets Bcl-2 on the surface of the cells, which can prevent the cells from dying.

In the body, cancer cells can sometimes become “resistant” to the drugs that are used to kill them. The most common example of this is when cancer cells start to produce a protein that can block the action of the drug. Malotilate is one of a number of drugs that target this protein.

When a person with cancer is taking a chemotherapy drug, malotilate is often used to “help” the body fight the cancer. In some cases, it is used in combination with the chemotherapy drug.

There is not enough evidence to determine whether malotilate is safe and effective in the treatment of cancer.

In some cases, people who have used malot

Response: Maltotriose is a drug that targets the extracellular N-acetylglucosamine-containing glycans and the mannose-specific lectin galectin-3. Maltotriose has been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease of the joints that causes debilitating pain and functional disability. Current RA therapies are not curative, and can have serious side effects. In RA, immune cells called T-cells recognize the body's own cells as foreign and attack them. The immune system then mistakenly attacks the joints, causing inflammation and the destruction of cartilage and bone.
RA is most often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and glucocorticoids. However,

Prompt:  MAXALT is a drug that targets
 
Response: MAXALT is a drug that targets the angiogenesis-initiating microenvironment. When administered systemically, the drug is taken up by tumour cells and released in the form of a hydrophobic prodrug (AGM-44M) that is taken up by nearby tumour cells, resulting in the formation of a metabolite that kills the cell.

We have shown previously that ALT can target dormant tumour cells, and that ALT is superior to the current gold standard of cancer treatment, chemotherapy, in terms of killing dormant tumour cells ([@bib17]; [@bib20]). However, the efficacy of ALT in clinical trials has been disappointing ([@bib3]). We have now developed a drug delivery platform that can target and kill dormant tumour cells in combination with ALT.

Our drug delivery platform is based on a hydrophobic prodrug, AGM-44M, that is formed when a chemotherapeutic

Prompt:  m-Cresol is a drug that targets
 
Response: m-Cresol is a drug that targets both isoenzymes of AKR. The effect of this drug on the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells has been examined. In vitro studies showed that this drug is effective in inhibiting the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of the cells was inhibited by up to 70% at 10 microM. The IC50 values for both isoenzymes of AKR were similar, and no difference in the inhibition of cell growth was observed between MCF-7 and T-47D cells. Furthermore, we observed that cresol, a metabolite of the drug, also inhibited the growth of the breast cancer cells. The inhibition of the growth of the cells by cresol was similar to that of the drug, and it was mediated through the induction of apoptosis. The mechanism of induction of apoptosis by cresol was examined, and we found that cresol induced casp

Prompt:  MDV3100 is a drug that targets
 
Response: MDV3100 is a drug that targets the IL-1 pathway. It has been developed as a treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in a phase 2 study, and is also being studied in clinical trials for psoriasis, juvenile dermatomyositis and Crohn's disease.

**How does it work?**

This drug is an IL-1 receptor antagonist. The IL-1 pathway plays an important role in inflammatory responses, and blocking it reduces inflammation. It is believed that there is a connection between IL-1 and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is the complex that is responsible for releasing the cytokine IL-1β from activated macrophages. By blocking IL-1β, the IL-1 pathway is blocked and the release of the cytokine is reduced.

Prompt:  Mecamylamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mecamylamine is a drug that targets the histamine system in the brain. It blocks the reuptake of histamine from the synapse. This makes more histamine available to act on its receptors. The histamine system has a major role in the modulation of mood and sleep. It is also involved in other biological functions such as wakefulness, attention, cognition, and memory. This drug is used to treat symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can also be used to treat sleep problems and some of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

Mecamylamine has been around for a long time. It was first synthesized in 1951 and was approved by the FDA in 1962. It was initially used to treat depression. Later, it was found to be effective in treating some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

Prompt:  Mechlorethamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mechlorethamine is a drug that targets topoisomerase II. The molecule was developed in the late 1950s, and was introduced in 1962 for the treatment of lymphatic leukaemia. This agent was a useful addition to the chemotherapy armamentarium, but the drug is limited by toxicity, and therefore use of the drug is now restricted to the treatment of patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia in combination with other agents. The drug has been shown to be effective in the treatment of lymphatic leukaemia, but there are only limited studies which indicate that the drug has clinical activity in other haematological malignancies.

The use of this drug has been limited by the development of cross-resistance with other drugs that target topoisomerase II, including VP-16, adriamycin, and etoposide. It is hoped that the use of a more potent topoisomerase II inhibitor in combination with other drugs may lead to the

Prompt:  Meclizine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Meclizine is a drug that targets the serotonin receptors, and has been used for decades to relieve allergic symptoms. It is one of the most common medications used to treat the symptoms of motion sickness and vertigo. It has also been used to relieve other symptoms like nausea and vomiting, and is one of the first medications used to relieve the nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy. However, meclizine is not approved for use in pregnancy.

Mechanism of Action

Meclizine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the central nervous system. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter that regulates many functions of the body, including mood, behavior, and sleep. Meclizine works by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain, and it does this by binding to the serotonin receptors in the brain.

Prompt:  Meclocycline is a drug that targets
 
Response: Meclocycline is a drug that targets microglia and thus has the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders. We evaluated the effect of meclocycline on hippocampal neurogenesis and found that it increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus and enhanced survival of newborn granule cells. The meclocycline-induced enhancement of neurogenesis was attenuated by blocking the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. These findings suggest that meclocycline could be a useful drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Prompt:  Medetomidine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Medetomidine is a drug that targets the central nervous system (CNS) to produce a sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effect. It is a highly selective α~2~-adrenergic agonist that causes sedation and analgesia, as well as decreases in heart rate and blood pressure. The sedative effect of medetomidine is primarily due to the binding of α~2~-adrenergic receptors in the CNS, causing inhibition of the central nervous system (CNS) transmission of nerve impulses. It is a selective α~2~-adrenergic receptor agonist, which has a higher affinity for the α~2~-receptor than for the α~1~-receptor.\[[@ref1]\]

Prompt:  MEDROL is a drug that targets
 
Response: MEDROL is a drug that targets the pituitary gland, which is the master gland that controls all of your body's hormones. Medrol, by itself, is a steroid hormone that can be used to treat pain, inflammation, swelling, and fever. Medrol, when taken by mouth, can be used to treat certain types of arthritis and to reduce inflammation in certain parts of the body. It is often prescribed for arthritis, fever, pain, and inflammation.

On the other hand, one of the side effects of Medrol is weight gain. This is because the pituitary gland is the master gland that controls the hormones that control how much food you eat. If the pituitary gland is not functioning properly, then the body can start to eat more food, which can lead to weight gain. However, when the pituitary gland is working correctly, then the body can start to eat less food, which can lead to weight loss. This is why you can

Response: Meglumine is a drug that targets the TGF-β signaling pathway, and is under clinical investigation for use in patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) ([@B1]). Although meglumine is a potent anti-fibrotic agent that significantly attenuates the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in experimental animal models of lung fibrosis, its efficacy has been limited by its low oral bioavailability ([@B2], [@B3]). To address this issue, we developed a strategy for improving oral bioavailability by combining meglumine with a biodegradable polymer (polyethylene glycol \[PEG\] polymers). We hypothesized that the resulting PEG-meglumine conjugate (PEG-ML) would have a superior pharmacokinetic profile and would be capable of significantly attenuating pulmonary fibrosis in an animal model of DPLD.

Prompt:  Mequinol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mequinol is a drug that targets CYP2D6 (the human enzyme that breaks down codeine) in the gut. It’s available as a prescription for pain management in Europe and Australia, and a less expensive version is available in the U.S. It works by blocking the opioid receptor, which is why people who take it can’t feel the pain. It’s also less likely to cause a dependency, because it doesn’t affect the same receptors in the brain as heroin. It’s just another option for people who are looking for alternatives to opioid medications.

The popularity of opioid medications for pain management has made the problem of addiction even worse. The most common addictive prescription drugs are opioid medications, which are given for chronic pain and help people get through some of the most painful and stressful times in their lives.

Unfortunately, opioid medications are also very addictive. The drug acts on the same receptors in the brain as

Prompt:  Mequitazine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mequitazine is a drug that targets the D2 dopamine receptor and has been used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. This report describes the occurrence of an unusual metabolic interaction between mequitazine and phenytoin. The drug is not metabolized in the liver, but it is oxidized in the liver. Thus, the patient had decreased metabolism of phenytoin and increased levels of the drug's metabolites. The pharmacokinetic data showed that the clearance of phenytoin was decreased by about 40%. Because phenytoin is a potent anticonvulsant, the patient was not exposed to the usual side effects of phenytoin, and mequitazine could be administered at a dosage of 100 mg daily without producing any untoward side effects.

Prompt:  Metformin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Metformin is a drug that targets the metabolic pathways and reduces blood glucose levels. It also acts as an insulin sensitizer, i.e. it increases the sensitivity of the insulin receptor to insulin. Metformin is indicated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Patients with T2DM and PCOS, as well as patients with pre-diabetes, have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) ([@R1]--[@R3]). Studies suggest that metformin improves the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with T2DM and PCOS ([@R4]--[@R6]). Metformin reduces blood glucose levels, reduces insulin resistance and decreases visceral fat ([@R7]). The exact mechanism by which metformin exerts its cardiovascular effects remains unclear.

Prompt:  Methacycline is a drug that targets
 
Response: Methacycline is a drug that targets the tRNA synthetase enzyme.

In a study by Bose et al. the enzyme methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) was shown to be a valid target for the drug metacycline, which interferes with the formation of tRNA-aminoacyl adenylate (aa-AMP) complex. Metacycline, the main component of the antibiotic metacycline, interferes with the formation of tRNA-aa-AMP complex. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase is the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of this complex. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase can be inhibited by drugs, which block the aa-AMP complex from binding to the enzyme. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) is an enzyme in the cell that is responsible for the formation of tRNA-aminoacyl ad

Prompt:  methazolamide is a drug that targets
 
Response: methazolamide is a drug that targets the cation channel in the Müller cell and prevents the release of ATP into the extracellular space, thus reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Müller cells. This reduction in ROS may prevent the increase in VEGF that is induced by ATP. In fact, a study on rat models of experimental glaucoma demonstrated that the intravitreal injection of a viral vector carrying the gene for S100B prevented the VEGF increase induced by ocular hypertension.[@b39-opth-10-2431]

One of the most important features of a gene therapy vector is its ability to efficiently deliver its payload into the target tissue. In this sense, gene therapy vectors have been classified according to their route of administration. The most common routes of administration of gene therapy vectors are intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravitreal. Although there is

Prompt:  methyclothiazide is a drug that targets
 
Response: methyclothiazide is a drug that targets the sodium-potassium pump, the primary pathway by which sodium is transported across the cell membrane, reducing the amount of sodium in the cell and increasing the amount of potassium. It also inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. These effects lead to a decrease in the number of H+ ions available to the cell for re-transport and so water follows the sodium out of the cell.  This causes cell swelling and reduced blood pressure.  It also reduces excitability of nerve cells, which results in sedation.  This drug is a long-acting benzothiadiazine diuretic.

Prompt:  Mexenone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mexenone is a drug that targets the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its mode of action involves the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and its subsequent opening. MPT is a process that is activated by a variety of insults, including oxidative stress, ischemia/reperfusion, and ATP depletion. The MPT pore is formed by a large protein complex called the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) which contains several regulatory proteins.
Mice with an inactivation of the mPTP inhibitor cyclophilin D (CyP-D) are protected against the development of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and show a reduction of the intracellular levels of Aβ. In addition, these mice show a reduction in the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and an increase in the

Prompt:  Mezlocillin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mezlocillin is a drug that targets the cell membrane. When administered, it diffuses through the plasma membrane and accumulates within the cells. Once inside the cell, it is metabolized by the cell membrane bound enzyme penicillinase. This enzyme is expressed in most bacteria and has an optimum temperature of about 55°C. This enzyme inactivates the antibiotic by converting it to inactive penicilloic acid. The active mezlocillin is able to penetrate the cell membrane, where it binds to the enzyme penicillinase and prevents the inactivation of the drug. The result is an increase in the activity of the drug in the cell.

Penicillinase, a form of β-lactamase, is an enzyme that is found in most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. The enzyme acts by cleaving the β-lactam ring of the penicillin molecule. The enzyme is not specific to penicillin, however

Prompt:  MGL-3196 is a drug that targets
 
Response: MGL-3196 is a drug that targets the TGF-β pathway and inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. A study by Steg et al. showed that the level of TGF-β is significantly higher in glioma cells than in normal cells \[[@CR20]\]. Thus, the inhibitory effect of MGL-3196 on glioma cell proliferation may be related to its ability to reduce the expression of TGF-β.

However, MGL-3196 has many other targets and biological effects. In addition to its anti-proliferative effects, MGL-3196 can also reduce the migration and invasion of glioma cells \[[@CR21]\]. In addition, it has been reported that MGL-3196 can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells and lung cancer cells \[[@CR22], [@CR23]\]. Thus, it is possible that the anti-prol

Prompt:  Mianserin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mianserin is a drug that targets serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptors. This drug was used in the 1970s to treat depression. Mianserin was then used as a treatment for panic disorders. It was later used as an anti-anxiety drug and is currently used for its anti-depressant effects. Mianserin has been shown to have anti-anxiety effects in patients with anxiety disorders, and it is thought that this is because it has some anti-depressant properties.

How Does Mianserin Work?

Mianserin is a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SRI). This means that it blocks the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic cell. This action has the effect of increasing the amount of serotonin that remains in the synaptic cleft, which increases the amount of serotonin that binds to the postsynaptic receptor.

Response: Milrinone is a drug that targets phosphodiesterase-5, a specific enzyme that degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In the myocardium, cGMP mediates the relaxation of the myocardial muscle. Thus, by inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5, milrinone is able to increase the concentration of cGMP, which results in myocardial relaxation and an increase in blood flow to the myocardium \[[@B1]\]. Milrinone has been shown to be an effective treatment for decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock in the emergency department \[[@B2]\]. We present a case of a patient with a pacemaker who developed cardiogenic shock after milrinone infusion.

Prompt:  Mizoribine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Mizoribine is a drug that targets an enzyme called IMPDH, which regulates a certain cellular process called purine metabolism. This enzyme converts guanine and adenine to guanine and adenine, respectively. The latter is then converted to inosine monophosphate by the purine salvage pathway. This purine salvage pathway is the primary pathway for the formation of purine nucleotides (adenine and guanine) in all cells. Thus, by inhibiting IMPDH, mizoribine inhibits purine metabolism and thereby suppresses the proliferation of tumor cells.

Mizoribine is a derivative of the natural purine nucleoside antibiotic hypoxanthine, which has been isolated from *Streptomyces miocenis*. This antibiotic has been used for the treatment of leukopenia and various viral infections in humans and animals. Mizoribine is a uridine analog, and is

Prompt:  MK-2206 is a drug that targets
 
Response: MK-2206 is a drug that targets the mTORC1 complex and has recently been shown to have potential as a therapy for the treatment of cancers such as breast, colon, and prostate cancers. However, a clinical trial using MK-2206 for the treatment of advanced cancers in combination with standard chemotherapy showed that MK-2206 did not improve patient survival and it did not have any synergistic effect when combined with standard chemotherapy (see Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00794723). The lack of efficacy of MK-2206 in clinical trials is likely due to the fact that mTORC1 is involved in many processes, including cell growth, survival, and metabolism. Indeed, the phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates, such as 4E-BP1 and S6K1, is associated with cellular proliferation and growth. Therefore, mTORC1 inhibitors, such as MK-2206, may be detrimental to cells in which mTORC1 is

Mechanism of action

Androgen receptors 

The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor family of transcription factors, which includes receptors for estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens. The receptor is composed of two functional domains, a ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a DNA-binding domain (DBD). The ligand-binding domain is composed of three alpha helices, three beta strands, and two zinc-coordinating cysteine residues. The ligand-binding domain is further divided into two subdomains

Response: MK-4827 is a drug that targets RORγt, the transcription factor of Th17 cells, and has been shown to reduce the production of IL-17 in humans and in animal models. MK-4827 is currently being investigated in phase II trials in patients with Crohn's disease (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01865617). However, MK-4827 is a selective inhibitor of RORγt, and not of RORα. This may have the potential to cause serious adverse effects if it were to be used in clinical practice.
For the reasons stated above, there is a need for new compounds which are capable of inhibiting RORγt activity, and which may be used to treat diseases and disorders associated with RORγt activity.

Prompt:  MLN2238 is a drug that targets
 
Response: MLN2238 is a drug that targets the protein FLT3 and inhibits the function of the FLT3 protein, which can cause uncontrolled cell growth in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We are developing a new type of therapy called 'pharmaco-oncology', which targets both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) and aims to destroy tumor cells by promoting their death. This is achieved by the use of a drug to target the FLT3 protein on the surface of tumor cells, but simultaneously to induce cell death in the TME. The drug is called LCL-161, which was developed by the Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Signaling (LCIS) in the Laboratory of Drug Discovery and Development (LD3D) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

In a preclinical model, we found that LCL-161 has a profound effect on the TME, which can be explained by the dual mode of action

Prompt:  Molidustat(BAY is a drug that targets
 
Response: Molidustat(BAY is a drug that targets the signaling pathways that induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key step in the progression of a number of cancers including breast cancer. Although this drug has been approved by the FDA, the only indications that it has are for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma, both of which are generally incurable.

Molidustat has recently been investigated as a potential anti-cancer agent for breast cancer. Two different groups found that molidustat inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, motility and invasiveness in a variety of cell lines and that this was mediated by inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The authors also found that molidustat caused a significant reduction in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer. This article describes these studies.

Response: MYSOLINE is a drug that targets MMP-2, which is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of the collagen that makes up the wall of the heart. The purpose of this study was to determine if the myocardial protective effects of MYSOLINE could be enhanced by pre-treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. The MYSOLINE/enalapril combination was superior to MYSOLINE alone in preserving the heart from the effects of global ischemia. Furthermore, enalapril was able to attenuate the accumulation of collagen in the infarcted area. In conclusion, these results suggest that the cardioprotective effects of MYSOLINE are enhanced by enalapril pre-treatment.

Prompt:  Naringin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Naringin is a drug that targets the inhibition of protein-protein interactions. The core protein in the protein-protein interaction is a tumor suppressor protein called p53. p53 is a protein that binds to DNA and promotes the transcription of the gene that codes for p53. p53 is a protein that suppresses tumor growth. p53 has the ability to induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells. In fact, p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Naringin binds to p53 and prevents it from interacting with other proteins, thereby inhibiting p53 activity. Naringin is known to be able to suppress cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Naringin can also activate p53. p53 is one of the major tumor suppressor proteins. In normal cells, p53 is present at a low level. In cancer cells, p53 is present at a high level. When p53 is activated by n

Response: ND-630 is a drug that targets MCL-1 and induces apoptosis in several types of cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ABT-737 on leukemic cells from patients with AML. The results showed that ABT-737 effectively induced apoptosis in all AML cells tested, including CD34+ cells, but not in normal CD34+ cells. ABT-737 increased the expression of BIM and PUMA, but not NOXA, in AML cells. BIM and PUMA protein levels were also increased in primary leukemic cells from patients with AML. Importantly, ABT-737 treatment induced AML cells to become more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that ABT-737 might be a potential therapeutic agent for AML.

Prompt:  Nicaraven is a drug that targets
 
Response: Nicaraven is a drug that targets the same biological mechanism as bupivacaine (a local anesthetic used for peripheral nerve block). It is a lipid soluble derivative of bupivacaine that is made in Europe for the treatment of postoperative pain. The lipid solubility is due to a substitution of the propyl group of bupivacaine with a benzoyl group. This allows for easier diffusion across the cell membrane and also allows for faster dissociation into the cell membrane. This drug is approved for intravenous use for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain. It is most commonly used to manage pain after cesarean sections.

Prompt:  Niclosamide is a drug that targets
 
Response: Niclosamide is a drug that targets a key enzyme of *E. coli* folate metabolism, dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS). This enzyme is part of the folate biosynthesis pathway, which is responsible for the production of the folic acid precursor dihydrofolate (DHF). This is the basis for the bactericidal action of niclosamide. DHPS is the first committed step of the pathway, and niclosamide acts as a competitive inhibitor, leading to the depletion of intracellular DHF and the accumulation of its toxic metabolite 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF), resulting in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and ultimately cell death. Niclosamide has been used in the treatment of various protozoal and helminthic infections in humans for over 40 years. In 2006, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that

Response: Ofloxacin is a drug that targets bacterial DNA gyrase.
Gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, is the target of quinolone drugs, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Gyrase is a target for the development of new antibacterial drugs because it is necessary for bacterial cell growth and it is found in only bacteria and not in humans. The gyrase from pathogenic bacteria is a potential target for new antibacterial drugs because the enzyme is involved in the regulation of bacterial DNA topology. Gyrase consists of two subunits, a GyrA protein and a GyrB protein. GyrB protein has ATPase activity and the ability to introduce negative supercoils into DNA. The GyrA protein contains the active site of gyrase and is responsible for the introduction of positive supercoils into DNA. The binding site for

Prompt:  Oleuropein is a drug that targets
 
Response: Oleuropein is a drug that targets and kills cancer cells, but a recent study has shown that it may also benefit people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Although the number of people infected with HIV is declining, it is still a huge problem, with more than 40 million people currently living with the virus worldwide.

In recent years, a number of drugs have been developed that can help to slow down the progression of the disease, but none of these has been found to be completely effective.

However, scientists from the University of Catania in Italy, the University of Verona in Italy and the University of Siena in Italy have found that oleuropein – a compound found in olives and olive oil – can kill HIV-infected cells.

In tests, the scientists found that the drug effectively reduced the levels of HIV in the blood of infected mice.

Response: OROTIC is a drug that targets lysosomal hydrolases that are essential for lysosomal degradation of autophagic substrates. In contrast to the rapid clearance of LC3B-II, ATG5-deficient cells were reported to be resistant to OROTIC treatment ([@bib9]). In addition, OROTIC was recently shown to inhibit lysosomal enzymes in cancer cells that are important for autophagic degradation of oncogenic proteins, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) ([@bib24]). Thus, the OROTIC-mediated induction of ER stress and activation of UPR could be one of the reasons for the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.

Response: ORY-1001 is a drug that targets the enzyme that converts L-arginine to L-citrulline in the urea cycle, which leads to the production of urea, the by-product of protein catabolism. The urea cycle is a series of metabolic reactions that occur in liver and kidneys that are involved in the detoxification of ammonia. In the urea cycle, L-arginine is converted to L-citrulline by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase, which is the rate-limiting step in the pathway. L-citrulline is then converted to L-arginine by the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. These two enzymes are inhibited by AGENCY-1001.

Prompt:  Oxcarbazepine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Oxcarbazepine is a drug that targets voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and calcium channels. Its main use is in the treatment of partial seizures, but it has also been found to be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. The precise mechanism of action is not completely understood. It is believed that oxcarbazepine inhibits VGSCs, thereby preventing the generation of epileptic discharges. In addition, it has been suggested that oxcarbazepine may also inhibit calcium channels, which would contribute to the drug's antiepileptic properties. This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of oxcarbazepine, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The results suggest that oxcarbazepine is well absorbed, and it is metabolized in the liver. The drug is rapidly eliminated, with a terminal half-life of less than 3 h.

Prompt:  Paroxetine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Paroxetine is a drug that targets a number of neurotransmitters and it has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Paroxetine is also used as a pharmacological stressor in functional neuroimaging studies in order to assess the integrity of the serotonin transporter.

Cognitive neuroscience research has focused on understanding how the different neurotransmitters interact in the brain and how the information is processed.

The brain is made up of billions of neurons that are connected by synapses.

The function of a neuron is to communicate with other neurons through chemical neurotransmitters, which are released from the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

In this way, the neurotransmitter allows for information to be passed from one neuron to another.

Paroxetine blocks the reuptake of serotonin in the presynaptic neuron.

This increases the concentration of serotonin in the

Prompt:  PCI-32765 is a drug that targets
 
Response: PCI-32765 is a drug that targets the ALS-linked protein TDP-43. A recent clinical trial in ALS patients was positive, showing that the drug was safe and may slow the disease’s progression. But the trial didn’t find a statistically significant improvement.

Scientists now say they have found a possible reason why. The trial, which was conducted by a group of physicians at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions, enrolled 65 patients. Of those, only 10 completed the entire 24-week treatment. The researchers also found that the drug only appeared to work for people with a specific mutation in the TDP-43 gene.

“Our results indicate that ALS is heterogeneous, and it’s possible that patients with mutations in TDP-43 might benefit from PCI-32765,” says Aaron Gitler, MD, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “This will need to be confirmed in a larger trial

Prompt:  p-Cresol is a drug that targets
 
Response: p-Cresol is a drug that targets bacterial ribosomes. This drug has been developed as a single agent to treat MRSA infections, and more recently has been used as part of a combination therapy with rifampin for MRSA infections. The combination therapy with p-Cresol and rifampin has been found to be more effective than either of the two drugs used as single agents in mouse models of MRSA infections.

History
p-Cresol was first discovered in 1881 by Arthur Ayerst. The drug was tested as a cure for TB in the early 1900s. In the late 1920s, the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of p-Cresol as a TB treatment. The ban was lifted in 1935 and it was later used to treat TB in an aerosol form. In the 1950s, p-Cresol was used to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. It was the first drug to be used to

Prompt:  Pentadecanoic is a drug that targets
 
Response: Pentadecanoic is a drug that targets the mammalian cell membrane. It was developed as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, but as a lipid, it can also enter the brain and have neuroprotective effects.

Pentadecanoic acid (PA) is a branched fatty acid with a chain length of 17 carbons and a single methyl group at the first carbon. It is one of the components of the lipids found in cell membranes, and is the most abundant fatty acid in animal tissues. The branched structure makes it more resistant to lipase digestion than the straight chain form of the same length. As a result, it is more likely to remain in the circulation and be transported to tissues.

The human body can synthesize PA from the essential amino acid leucine, but it is not required for normal growth and development. The liver produces more than 90% of the total PA in the body.

In addition, there are ongoing trials combining an mTOR inhibitor with temozolomide in children with refractory solid tumors ([@b4-btt-2-433]).

The data presented in this manuscript provide additional evidence of the activity of the mTOR inhibitor in pediatric neuroblastoma. Our findings suggest that mTOR inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma. In addition, mTOR inhibitors may be particularly beneficial in patients with tumors that overexpress MYCN, which has been shown

Prompt:  PF-05208749 is a drug that targets
 
Response: PF-05208749 is a drug that targets DNA-PK, a protein that is essential for NHEJ repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the nucleus. DSBs are a common cause of cancer cell death. In order to repair a DSB, a cell must use either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). If a DSB is repaired by HR, then the DSB is repaired with an intact copy of the sister chromatid. HR is an error-free process, which means that if a DSB is not repaired by HR, the cell dies. HR is an error-prone process, meaning that it occurs at a low frequency, but the repair of a DSB by HR can result in a large number of mutations. These mutations can result in a cancerous cell that has the potential to metastasize. NHEJ is an error-prone process,

Response: PF-06651600 is a drug that targets a class of proteins known as cysteine proteases. Cysteine proteases are a large group of enzymes, which includes cysteine cathepsins (CatB, CatL, CatS), papain-like cysteine proteases (PlcP), and calpains (calpain I, calpain II, and calpain III). Cysteine cathepsins are primarily lysosomal enzymes that play a role in the turnover of intracellular proteins. In contrast, the papain-like cysteine proteases are secreted and localized to the extracellular space where they are involved in a number of functions, including: digestion, immune function, and signal transduction. The calpains are intracellular cysteine proteases that are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. CatB, CatL, and CatS are the only cysteine cat

Response: PF-06700841 is a drug that targets the actin cytoskeleton. Although it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma, it was withdrawn from the market because of cardiotoxicity. More recently, PF-06700841 has been shown to target actin-based motility in breast cancer. We found that PF-06700841 inhibits the formation of cell protrusions in triple-negative breast cancer cells and prevents cell motility and invasion in both 2D and 3D cultures. PF-06700841 disrupted actin stress fibers and cell-cell adhesions. PF-06700841 also disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and impaired the organization of the Golgi complex and microtubules in breast cancer cells.

Response: PHA-848125 is a drug that targets the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor and disrupts the interactions between Notch and its ligands. We show that PHA-848125 inhibits Notch-dependent HES1 and Hey1 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. This effect is independent of canonical Notch signaling, and it results from the disruption of a protein complex formed by Notch, the ubiquitin ligase and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (RBP-Jk) and the histone acetyltransferase p300. PHA-848125 inhibits the proliferation of leukaemia cells by inducing G1 arrest and apoptosis. PHA-848125 could represent a new therapeutic option for leukaemia.

Response: Phenacetin is a drug that targets the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is used for pain relief. The molecular basis of its binding is still unclear, although several groups have proposed different hypotheses \[[@B1]\]. One hypothesis is that phenacetin can bind the receptor with the amine-receptor-binding site, thereby producing a change in the receptor\'s conformation \[[@B2]\]. However, other groups have suggested that phenacetin interacts with the aromatic-cation-binding site, based on the observations that the interaction between phenacetin and the receptor is pH-dependent and that phenacetin increases the affinity of the receptor for acetylcholine \[[@B3]\]. These authors have suggested that the effect of phenacetin on the receptor\'s conformation might be explained by an interaction between phenacetin and an aromatic amino acid residue in the receptor\'s aromatic-cation-binding site.

1.5. Induction of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) {#sec1.5}
---------------------------------------------------------

EMT is a physiological process that occurs during embryogenesis. However, in the adult, it also plays a crucial role in the development of chronic diseases. In EMT, cells lose their cell polarity and acquire migratory properties. In this process, cells lose the epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and β-catenin, and acquire mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin and fibronectin. This phenomenon is closely associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis

Prompt:  Phthalic is a drug that targets
 
Response: Phthalic is a drug that targets the human androgen receptor (AR). It is used to treat prostate cancer, and it is the first drug to be approved for treatment of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Since it is a first-line treatment for prostate cancer, understanding the molecular changes associated with resistance to this drug is important.

To this end, researchers have studied the effects of phthalic on androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells (PC-3). Phthalic treatment inhibited the growth of both cell lines, but the effect was more pronounced in the LNCaP cells. The LNCaP cells were treated with phthalic for 48 hours and the cells were analyzed using RNA-seq. This analysis identified the induction of genes that promote apoptosis, as well as the suppression of genes that promote cell growth and migration.

Prompt:  Picrotoxinin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Picrotoxinin is a drug that targets the GABA-A receptor. This drug is a blocker of the GABA-A receptor and therefore, it is used to examine the role of the GABA-A receptor in behavior. It is also used to study the role of GABA in the brain and in learning and memory.

When picrotoxinin is injected into the brain, it binds to the GABA-A receptor. The GABA-A receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel and the picrotoxinin binding site is the chloride ion channel. When picrotoxinin binds to the GABA-A receptor, it inhibits the GABA-A receptor and it causes the chloride ion channel to open. The chloride ion channel is a channel that allows the flow of chloride ions. When the chloride ion channel opens, it allows chloride ions to flow into the cell. The chloride ions cause the membrane potential to become more positive and they cause the membrane to depolarize

Prompt:  Pinene is a drug that targets
 
Response: Pinene is a drug that targets A2A adenosine receptors (A2ARs). Pineal gland activation in the brain and the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythm have been linked to the A2A adenosine receptor. In this study, we show that pineal gland activation by pinealectomy in rats or by the activation of A2A receptors with the specific agonist NECA increased the spontaneous motor activity, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with a selective A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385. The increase in spontaneous motor activity was accompanied by an increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep. These data suggest that A2A receptors may be involved in the regulation of spontaneous motor activity and sleep in the brain.

Prompt:  PK-1587 is a drug that targets
 
Response: PK-1587 is a drug that targets both NSP4 and the Aβ42 peptide, and is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. It binds to the amino terminus of NSP4 and thus inhibits NSP4-mediated neurodegeneration in a manner similar to NSP4 neutralizing antibodies. However, unlike antibodies, PK-1587 does not interfere with NSP4 binding to its receptor, NRP1, which is required for NSP4-mediated cellular trafficking and pathogenesis.

PK-1587 has been found to have no effect on Aβ42 levels in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that PK-1587 will not interfere with NSP4’s Aβ42-lowering activity. In fact, PK-1587 was found to increase Aβ42 levels in mice expressing human APP transgenes, a finding that has important implications for the use of PK-1587 in AD treatment.

Prompt:  Polydatin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Polydatin is a drug that targets cancer cell mitochondria, and has the potential to be used to treat several types of cancer including breast cancer. However, due to its insolubility in water, polydatin cannot be administered orally, and therefore cannot be used as a single agent. In order to be effective, polydatin must be formulated with a suitable carrier in order to improve its solubility and oral bioavailability. In this study, we used a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion technique to formulate polydatin in liposomes. The physicochemical properties of the polydatin liposomes were investigated, and the in vitro release profiles of polydatin from the polydatin liposomes were also investigated. The encapsulation efficiency of polydatin was 83.6 ± 1.9%. The mean diameter of the polydatin liposomes was 97.8 ± 5.5 nm, and

Response: Prilocaine is a drug that targets voltage-gated sodium channels and has analgesic, local anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties ([@B1], [@B2]). Although prilocaine is safe and has few side effects, its intravenous (IV) administration is limited by a short duration of action and low plasma concentration ([@B3], [@B4]). To increase the plasma concentration of prilocaine, IV administration of prilocaine has been combined with liposomes, a drug delivery system that allows for prolonged drug release in vivo ([@B5]). Previous studies have shown that IV administration of prilocaine in combination with liposomes results in a more rapid onset of anesthesia and a longer duration of anesthesia than that obtained with IV administration of prilocaine alone ([@B6]--[@B9]). However, the mechanism by which liposomes increase the plasma concentration of prilocaine is unclear.

Prompt:  proadifen is a drug that targets
 
Response: proadifen is a drug that targets the prostaglandin D2 receptor, DP2. It is used for the treatment of pain, asthma, and inflammation. It is marketed under the trade name Voltaren.

It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was first developed in 1988 and approved by the FDA in 1998. It is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Mechanism of action
DP2 receptor antagonists, such as celecoxib, inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and thus reduce the synthesis of prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by COX is thought to be the principal mechanism by which the anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs occurs.

History
The first clinical trials were performed on rats, monkeys, and dogs. Voltaren was first introduced for use in humans in 1998.

Prompt:  Procarbazine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Procarbazine is a drug that targets the dopamine transporter (DAT). This protein is located on the cell surface of dopamine neurons and plays a role in reuptake of dopamine into the presynaptic terminal. Procarbazine acts by binding to the DAT and inhibits its function. Procarbazine is the parent drug of a family of procarbazine metabolites. The most potent metabolites are the cyclic amine-containing metabolites, including propyl amine, 2-methyl propyl amine, and 3-methyl propyl amine.

Procarbazine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1956 for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and in 1965 for the treatment of acute leukemia. It was the first agent to demonstrate significant response rates in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and acute leukemia. It is also used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Prompt:  procyclidine is a drug that targets
 
Response: procyclidine is a drug that targets glutamate receptors and is often used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. As a result, there has been a renewed interest in the potential use of procyclidine as a novel antidepressant. However, there is limited data available on the antidepressant effects of procyclidine. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of procyclidine in a forced swim test in mice. Mice were administered with procyclidine (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg) or imipramine (10 mg/kg) and tested in a forced swim test. We found that procyclidine significantly reduced immobility time at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, whereas imipramine significantly reduced immobility time at a dose of 10 mg/kg. We also found that procyclidine significantly decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test. These results suggest that procyclidine may be an effective treatment for

Prompt:  PROFENAL is a drug that targets
 
Response: PROFENAL is a drug that targets GABAergic synapses and is used to treat generalized anxiety disorders. It was discovered by Pierre Deniker at Hoffmann-La Roche in 1986, and was introduced as a drug in 1991. Profenal is the first example of a GABAergic partial agonist.

"Profenal can be considered a pro-drug of gabapentin, and its activity is mediated by the alpha-2-delta subunit of the calcium channel."

[from Hoffmann-La Roche]

Profenal is the first example of a GABAergic partial agonist.

GABAergic synapses are synapses that contain both GABA and glutamate. The GABAergic synapse can be either excitatory or inhibitory.

The main difference between the GABAergic synapse and the glutamatergic synapse is that the GABAergic synapse is blocked by GABA receptor antagonists, but not by glutamate receptor antagonists

QUINCY, MA – Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have discovered that a naturally occurring flavonoid, quercetin, inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells by targeting the telomerase enzyme.

In addition, the researchers showed that quercetin inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model of prostate cancer.

“Our results suggest that quercetin, a drug that has been used safely in human populations for decades, has the potential to be a useful treatment for prostate cancer,” said lead author Michael I. Freund, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology.

The author examined the effects of quinacrine on cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and compared the results with those of a standard drug, gemcitabine. The author used a multistage carcinogenesis model that involves three phases: initiation, promotion, and progression. Quinacrine had a greater antiproliferative effect than gemcitabine in the initiation phase, with similar effects in the promotion and progression phases. In a clinical study, the author administered quinacrine at the maximal tolerated dose to nine patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, and the results were similar to those of gemcitabine. These findings indicate that quinacrine is a useful drug for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

Prompt:  Quinine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Quinine is a drug that targets the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram. Quinine blocks the potassium channel and depolarizes the myocardium. The electrophysiologic basis of this drug effect has been investigated in isolated myocardial tissues, and quinine was found to produce a slow inward current (I(s)) that is mediated by a calcium-activated potassium current. In addition, quinine was found to prolong the cardiac action potential and the effective refractory period (ERP) of the cardiac tissue. These findings led to the hypothesis that quinine may be useful in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. This hypothesis has been investigated in animal models of ventricular arrhythmias, and quinine has been shown to prevent or terminate the ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
In addition to its antiarrhythmic activity, quinine has

Prompt:  R is a drug that targets
 
Response: R is a drug that targets protein translation. This mechanism is thought to be central to the success of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The purpose of this study was to determine whether TKI-induced changes in protein translation are sufficient to explain the observed clinical efficacy of BCR-ABL TKIs. By using an siRNA screen of 722 mRNAs that regulate translation, we found that TKI treatment in CML cells induced changes in translation initiation, elongation, and ribosomal subunit assembly. Moreover, these changes were specific to the translation of a subset of mRNAs that included mRNAs encoding growth factors and cytokines. These data indicate that the translation of mRNAs encoding growth factors and cytokines is a key mechanism by which BCR-ABL TKIs exert their anti-leukemic activity in CML.

Prompt:  Raltitrexed is a drug that targets
 
Response: Raltitrexed is a drug that targets cells in which topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is overexpressed. TOP1 is an enzyme that controls the structure of DNA, allowing it to twist around itself, to form supercoils, and to relax the twist. Cells in which TOP1 is overexpressed often become more sensitive to the drug, because the supercoils interfere with the replication of the DNA and prevent it from being replicated accurately.

Raltitrexed is the active ingredient in the drug, which is available as a tablet. It is available in the United States as a prescription drug, used in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda) to treat cancer.

Response: Ramelteon is a drug that targets the melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) and it is the first of a new class of drugs called the melatonin receptor agonists. It was approved by the FDA in October of 2005 and it is marketed as a sleep aid.

Ramelteon has been shown to be effective for insomnia. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline, but they stopped its development after it failed to show any improvement in sleep in two large clinical trials. It was subsequently acquired by Allergan, Inc. and renamed Odomzo. In January of 2005, Allergan released a pivotal trial showing that ramelteon was effective for sleep.

Ramelteon was developed as a sleep aid, but it was designed to be a long acting melatonin receptor agonist that would have less side effects than melatonin itself. In fact, the drug is actually more effective than melatonin itself.

Prompt:  RANEXA is a drug that targets
 
Response: RANEXA is a drug that targets the RAN GTPase. It is in Phase II clinical trials for patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia. We have previously demonstrated that the RAN GTPase is required for the growth of leukemic cells and we have shown that RANEXA selectively kills leukemic cells while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells. In this proposal we plan to investigate the mechanisms by which RANEXA mediates its effects on leukemic cells. We hypothesize that RANEXA induces cell death in leukemia cells through inhibition of the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity of the RAN GTPase, which in turn leads to RAN GTPase activation and downstream signaling events that ultimately result in apoptosis. In the first aim of this proposal we plan to investigate the role of the RAN GAP in RANEXA-mediated cell death. In the

Prompt:  Refametinib is a drug that targets
 
Response: Refametinib is a drug that targets the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, a cell signaling pathway that is often dysregulated in melanoma. One of the proteins that it inhibits is the BRAF kinase. BRAF is a protein kinase that regulates cell growth and differentiation. It is often mutated in melanoma and other cancers. The FDA approved the drug in 2011. It is used to treat BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. It is not approved for use in BRAF-wild type melanoma.

Patients must undergo a screening test to see if their tumors have a mutation in BRAF. If they do, they can take the drug. However, it may take several months before they can see the results of their screening test.

If the screening test shows that their tumors are BRAF-wild type, they cannot take the drug.

Prompt:  RELENZA is a drug that targets
 
Response: RELENZA is a drug that targets myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and can be used to treat cancer patients who are refractory to standard treatment. We found that resveratrol, a natural compound with anticancer properties, increases the antitumor effects of lenvatinib. Moreover, we found that the combined use of resveratrol and lenvatinib significantly increased the number of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we found that this combined therapy effectively decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This combined therapy also decreased the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs), but increased the number of CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that this combination therapy can be used as a new approach for the treatment of cancer.

Prompt:  Reserpine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Reserpine is a drug that targets the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and has been used to treat hypertension for over 50 years. Reserpine is also used to induce a form of catatonia, called "reserpine-induced catatonia" (RIC). The mechanism of action of reserpine has been attributed to depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine (DA) in the brain, but also serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). However, it has recently been shown that reserpine-induced catatonia is independent of DA and 5-HT depletion, but is associated with an increase in tryptophan (TRP) levels in the brain ([@B1], [@B2]). In the brain, TRP is the precursor for 5-HT, and depletion of TRP can lead to depletion of 5-HT ([@B3]). Moreover, TRP has been shown to be elevated in

Prompt:  resveratrol is a drug that targets
 
Response: resveratrol is a drug that targets the enzymes involved in energy metabolism. These enzymes are inhibited by resveratrol, thus the metabolism of glucose, lipids and proteins is altered. These effects are dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. In humans, resveratrol has been shown to decrease blood glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. A clinical trial was conducted with 18 healthy volunteers to determine the effect of resveratrol on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. The results of this trial showed that after 6 weeks of resveratrol supplementation, there was a significant reduction in blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. In addition, a significant increase in fasting insulin levels was also observed. Therefore, in healthy subjects, resveratrol was able to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.

Prompt:  retapamulin is a drug that targets
 
Response: retapamulin is a drug that targets the enzyme chitin synthase, which is an essential enzyme in the synthesis of chitin, a component of fungal cell walls. Antifungal drugs targeting chitin synthase are generally fungistatic, and this has been a challenge for their development. While these drugs have a wide spectrum of antifungal activity, their utility has been limited by toxicity and the lack of a mechanism to enhance their effectiveness against fungal pathogens. This project will develop a method to overcome these limitations. This method involves developing an improved compound with greater activity against chitin synthase and testing it in vivo. The approach is to synthesize a series of compounds, and to determine the ability of these compounds to inhibit the growth of fungi. We will also determine the ability of these compounds to enhance the activity of fluconazole against the fungi. This study will develop an improved compound that is a potent antifungal, and that

Prompt:  Riboflavin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Riboflavin is a drug that targets riboflavin kinase (RFK), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of FAD. RFK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of riboflavin to FMN and a pyrophosphate. Inhibition of RFK leads to decreased FAD levels and in turn a decrease in ATP production and hence energy generation. RFK is ubiquitously expressed and is upregulated in cancer cells. RFK inhibitors have shown preclinical efficacy in several tumor types. To date, there have been no published clinical trials evaluating RFK inhibitors in any tumor type.

AbbVie is developing APO866 as a single agent and in combination with other drugs for the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. APO866 is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, first-in-class, ATP-competitive inhibitor of RFK.

Prompt:  Ritonavir is a drug that targets
 
Response: Ritonavir is a drug that targets a number of cellular functions and its mechanism of action is poorly understood.

Prompt:  Ropivacaine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Ropivacaine is a drug that targets the nerve cell membrane sodium channels, thereby causing cell membrane depolarization and reducing the conduction of nerve impulses. The local anesthetic effect of ropivacaine is due to the formation of nonconductive channels in the cell membrane of nerve fibers. Ropivacaine has an anesthetic effect when injected into nerve tissue, resulting in a loss of sensation and pain in the area of the injected nerve. The effectiveness of ropivacaine is affected by the amount of drug injected, the number of nerves injected, and the area of the body in which the nerves are located.

The ability of ropivacaine to affect nerves varies by individual. An anesthetic effect is often seen within minutes of injection, and maximum anesthetic effect may not be reached for several hours.

Prompt:  Rosiglitazone is a drug that targets
 
Response: Rosiglitazone is a drug that targets the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma and can be used for treatment of type-2 diabetes. Recently, we have demonstrated that rosiglitazone induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-3 in human dermal fibroblasts and also increased the secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-3 into the culture medium. The production of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by human dermal fibroblasts is stimulated by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and this effect can be blocked by rosiglitazone. Furthermore, the activation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by TGF-beta1 is mediated by the Smad pathway. These results suggest that rosiglitazone induces MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in human dermal fibroblasts via

Response: Rotenone is a drug that targets complex I of the electron transport chain and is used to study the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. We have found that rotenone induces apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In addition, rotenone induces oxidative stress, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, and increases the release of cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria. In a previous study, we found that rotenone causes the disruption of axonal mitochondrial transport in the hippocampal mossy fibers. However, the precise mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by rotenone is not known. In this study, we used small interfering RNA to knockdown the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in SH-SY5Y cells, and found that the mitochondrial fission induced by rotenone was suppressed. In addition, rotenone induced the translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria and the oligomerization of Dr

Response: Rotigotine is a drug that targets the D3 receptor, and has been approved for use in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,688,792 and 5,814,694). Rotigotine is a D3 receptor agonist that is chemically related to apomorphine and pergolide. Like these prior art dopamine agonists, rotigotine is a potent D3 receptor agonist. However, unlike apomorphine and pergolide, rotigotine is a non-amphetamine dopamine agonist. Thus, it does not produce the same side effects associated with dopamine agonists such as the amphetamines.
Rotigotine was first described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,792. In the '792 patent, rotigotine was first synthesized as the free base. The patentees stated that the free base of rotigotine had a short half-life. They

Prompt:  Roxithromycin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Roxithromycin is a drug that targets macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS~B~) antibiotic resistance, a phenotype encoded by the 23S rRNA gene. It is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic with good oral bioavailability, and a long elimination half-life of approximately 8 h. Roxithromycin is used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* \[[@CR1]\]. It is also used in combination with clarithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia \[[@CR2]\].

The most common adverse events (AEs) of roxithromycin are gastrointestinal (GI) and nervous system disorders, and these can be observed at therapeutic doses. In clinical trials, the incidence of GI AEs was similar between the treatment groups (30

Prompt:  R-Ruxolitinib is a drug that targets
 
Response: R-Ruxolitinib is a drug that targets JAK2, a protein that is required for normal development and that is mutated in myeloproliferative neoplasms. In the bone marrow, this protein is involved in the production of cytokines that are important in cell signaling. It is not clear how this drug works, but it is possible that it targets the JAK2 mutation itself or the tumor cells.

Another important question is whether ruxolitinib is likely to help with high-risk diseases. The trial only included patients with high-risk disease, but it is possible that the drug would not work as well in low-risk disease.

The good news is that ruxolitinib was well tolerated.

Overall, these results are promising, but they are not definitive. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib in treating this group of patients.

Prompt:  RRx-001 is a drug that targets
 
Response: RRx-001 is a drug that targets a protein called Mdm2. It’s a protein that normally prevents a protein called p53 from being activated. When it does this, it prevents the cell from being killed by the p53 protein.

The drug is a molecule that binds to Mdm2 and “unlocks” the protein so it can’t do its normal job of stopping p53. This makes it easier for p53 to do its job and make the cell die.

The drug was tested in a clinical trial in humans, where it was shown to reduce the growth of several kinds of cancer, including lymphoma, leukemia, and lung cancer.

Now, a new study shows that the drug is very safe, and can even be used in combination with other drugs to increase the effectiveness of treatment.

The drug is now being tested in a phase III clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy drugs to treat advanced lung cancer.

Prompt:  (R)-Serine is a drug that targets
 
Response: (R)-Serine is a drug that targets the synthesis of tryptophan (Trp) from chorismate (Chor). A recent study suggested that the ratio of (R)-Serine to (S)-Serine in the brain is increased after an injection of (R)-Serine, but the increase was not large enough to explain the effect of (R)-Serine ([@B37]).

Serine Biosynthesis
-------------------

The pathway of Serine synthesis is shown in [Figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. Serine can be synthesized from three different pathways: the 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) pathway, the glycolysis pathway, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The 3-PGA pathway is used for biosynthesis of glycine, glycerol, and phospholipids, and for cell growth and proliferation ([@B

Prompt:  RTA is a drug that targets
 
Response: RTA is a drug that targets the S1P1 receptor on macrophages and sphingosine kinase 1, which are both involved in the formation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway. In contrast to the high S1P1 receptor expression on lymphocytes, the expression of the S1P1 receptor is low on other immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Therefore, RTA has been expected to exhibit fewer side effects compared with FTY720, which inhibits lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs. However, when RTA was orally administered in the early phase of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which is a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the effect was similar to that of FTY720 ([@B1]). We have previously reported that the effect of RTA is mediated by binding to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1

Prompt:  Rucaparib is a drug that targets
 
Response: Rucaparib is a drug that targets poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes and has demonstrated significant activity in the treatment of patients with BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer (OvCa). PARP inhibitors have been shown to be a valuable therapeutic option for patients with BRCA mutated cancers and therefore, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted marketing authorization to Olaparib and Rucaparib. In addition, rucaparib is currently being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in phase II and III clinical trials in patients with OvCa. In this study, we report the results of a phase II trial evaluating rucaparib monotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive OvCa.

Prompt:  S1037 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S1037 is a drug that targets the FGFR2 and inhibits FGFR2 phosphorylation. However, the underlying mechanism by which S1037 inhibits the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells is not known. We examined the effects of S1037 on the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is frequently activated in osteosarcoma and involved in the proliferation and survival of osteosarcoma cells. We found that S1037 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and Ser473, which are required for AKT activation. We also found that S1037 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but did not affect the phosphorylation of AKT. The phosphorylation of AKT was not affected by LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, indicating that S1037 inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT through the direct inhibition of FGFR2. Our

Prompt:  S1499 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S1499 is a drug that targets the interleukin-1β receptor. It is currently being tested in a phase II clinical trial in humans.

Future directions 

IL-1 is the only cytokine that activates NF-κB, which has many functions including the activation of transcription factors. NF-κB regulates the expression of a large number of genes, many of which are involved in the inflammatory response. Therefore, it is not surprising that IL-1β has been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.  It is likely that in the future, IL-1 will be found to be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases.

Prompt:  S1RA is a drug that targets
 
Response: S1RA is a drug that targets the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint. It is an immune checkpoint inhibitor with immunomodulatory activity that has been shown to improve disease control in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression on platinum-based therapy. However, the toxicity profile of this drug has been poor. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab, a PD-1 antibody, in combination with ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Methods

Patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with either nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Toxicity was assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Prompt:  S3003 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3003 is a drug that targets DNA methyltransferases and leads to the demethylation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A and 3B. These enzymes are responsible for the maintenance of methylation on cytosines in the DNA.

*DNMT1* methylation is increased in MM and is correlated with poor prognosis in multiple myeloma. It is also thought to be involved in drug resistance. DNMT1 expression was knocked down by siRNA in MM cell lines and was found to be associated with increased sensitivity to the drug.

It was also found that DNMT3A and 3B methylate non-CpG regions of the DNA. The relationship between DNMT3A and 3B methylation and the disease has not been studied as much.

The relationship between hypermethylation and hypermethylation in the BCL6 gene has been studied. Hypermethylation in the BCL6 gene is associated with its downregulation.

Response: S3605 is a drug that targets a specific component of the yeast vacuolar membrane, Vma4, to kill cancer cells.^[@CR30]^ By modulating the V-ATPase, S3605 reduces the pH in the acidic environment of the lysosome, thereby causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization.^[@CR30]^ In this study, we showed that S3605 inhibited both tumour cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC cells. However, we found that the effects of S3605 on cell proliferation were not dependent on the vacuolar pH. Thus, the effects of S3605 on HCC cell proliferation are unlikely to be due to the inhibition of the V-ATPase. Moreover, we demonstrated that the effects of S3605 on cell proliferation were associated with the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis.

Prompt:  S3615 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3615 is a drug that targets and inhibits PKC activity, thus blocking both NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways. TNFα production was reduced by 30% in these cells, suggesting that PKC activity is required for TNFα production ([@B45]). These findings show that NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways are required for the induction of TNFα production by pyrin inflammasomes. In addition, studies using PKC inhibitors show that PKC activation is necessary for IL-1β and IL-18 production in LPS-stimulated macrophages ([@B46]). These findings suggest that both NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways are necessary for pyrin inflammasome-mediated cytokine production.

Prompt:  S3623 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3623 is a drug that targets the mTOR pathway in tumor cells and reduces the activity of mTOR in cells. A preclinical study showed that S3623 was effective in preclinical models of various cancers, including breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancers. In a phase 1 trial, S3623 was safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Background

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. S6K1, S6, and 4E-BP1 are downstream effectors of mTOR and are involved in the regulation of protein translation. In addition, mTOR has an important role in the development of cancer and is implicated in resistance to cancer therapy. S6K1 has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and cell survival, and inhibition of S6K1 activity results in apoptosis of tumor cells. mTOR inhibitors

Prompt:  S3625 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3625 is a drug that targets the DNA damage response pathway, which is activated in cancer cells after DNA damage. In the study, S3625 is applied in a combination with PARP inhibitors. This drug is an epigenetic modulator, which is an inhibitor of EZH2 and DNMT1. The combination of the two inhibitors leads to a decrease in the level of *EGFR* and *KRAS* genes. However, a combined application of the drug and a PARP inhibitor, like olaparib, did not increase the activity of the PARP inhibitor, as compared to the activity of olaparib alone. This observation may be related to the observation that, when combined with a PARP inhibitor, the drug only marginally affected the activity of the PARP inhibitor, as compared to the effect of the PARP inhibitor alone \[[@B12-cancers-12-01168]\].

Prompt:  S3635 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3635 is a drug that targets the EGFR. We will be able to determine if it is a true EGFR inhibitor by evaluating its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR. In addition, we will also be able to determine if it inhibits the signaling pathway downstream of EGFR that is responsible for cell proliferation. The combination of molecular docking, in vitro assays and in vivo xenograft models will allow us to determine if this drug is able to target and inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway. The success of this project will allow us to develop a better understanding of how the EGFR signaling pathway is involved in cancer. The understanding of the EGFR signaling pathway will allow us to develop better therapies for cancer.

Prompt:  S3636 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3636 is a drug that targets Bax/Bak and is able to induce apoptosis of tumour cells in vitro and in vivo. This drug was also found to induce apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and increase the expression of anti-angiogenic factors, such as TSP-1 and endostatin. In clinical studies, S3636 has been shown to induce apoptosis of solid tumours and to have an acceptable safety profile \[[@B39]\].

A phase II study of S3636 in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma showed an ORR of 16% and DCR of 44% \[[@B40]\]. In the phase II study of S3636 in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the ORR was 11% and the DCR was 56% \[[@B41]\].

Prompt:  S3637 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3637 is a drug that targets GSK-3β (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). To evaluate the function of S3637 on GSK-3β, we treated U251 and U87 cells with S3637. We found that S3637 increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (Figure [4A](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). The levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β were higher in the S3637-treated cells than in the DMSO-treated cells. These results suggest that S3637 may increase the phosphorylation of GSK-3β. To investigate whether GSK-3β inhibition increases the sensitivity of GBM cells to S3637, we treated GBM cells with S3637 after inhibiting GSK-3β by a pharmacological inhibitor. We found that S3637 increased the cell death of GBM cells

Prompt:  S3638 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3638 is a drug that targets Src and Src family kinases (SFKs). In this study, we investigated the efficacy of S3638 in a genetically engineered model of PDAC, in which PDAC-initiating cells (PDAICs) express Src. S3638 effectively reduced the number of PDAICs and the size of the resulting tumor. Mechanistically, S3638 caused downregulation of Src expression and reduced phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416. These effects were not mediated by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or autophagy, but were associated with a reduction in cell migration and invasion. In vivo, S3638 significantly reduced the number of tumor-initiating cells and the size of the resulting tumors. In addition, S3638 also decreased tumor-associated angiogenesis and promoted an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These data demonstrate that S3638 inhibits PDAICs and supp

Prompt:  S3639 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3639 is a drug that targets HSP90 and was found to have strong activity against KRAS^G12D^-driven tumors \[[@R34]\]. The combination of BI 6727 and S3639 showed a strong synergy, which was not observed when the drugs were used individually.

Combining BI 6727 and S3639 enhanced the killing of *KRAS*-mutant tumors, regardless of whether the tumors were KRAS^G12D^-driven or KRAS^WT^-driven. Interestingly, BI 6727 and S3639 were able to enhance the killing of *KRAS*-mutant tumors even when the *KRAS*-mutant tumors had KRAS^WT^. This is particularly intriguing because KRAS^WT^ is thought to be refractory to drug treatment. These data suggest that the combination of HSP90 inhibitors with standard-of-care drugs can be effective in targeting KRAS^

Prompt:  S3641 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3641 is a drug that targets a previously undescribed mechanism of action. We demonstrate that CID‐S3641 treatment inhibits growth of CML cells through dual mechanisms: direct inhibition of tyrosine kinases that drive CML cell growth and also induction of p53‐mediated cell death. CID‐S3641 was well tolerated and, at higher doses, was able to induce a rapid and durable complete remission in a subset of patients with CML.

The first‐in‐class CID‐S3641 (NVP‐LDE225) is a potent and selective ATP‐competitive inhibitor of the TEL‐JAK2 fusion protein. The fusion protein drives leukemogenesis in BCR‐ABL1‐positive CML, and TEL‐JAK2 is present in up to 30% of patients with CML.[6](#ejh13502-bib-0006){ref-type="ref"}, [

Prompt:  S3642 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3642 is a drug that targets an enzyme involved in the degradation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The drug can be given orally and has a high bioavailability, so it is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). It is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and works by increasing the amount of cGMP in the penis, which causes the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis, and the blood vessels, resulting in an increase in blood flow and an erection. The oral drug is taken once a day. The drug is believed to be a viable treatment option for ED, and it is in Phase 3 clinical trials.

Dapoxetine is another drug that targets an enzyme involved in the degradation of GPCRs. It works by increasing the amount of cGMP in the penis, which causes the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penis, and the blood vessels, resulting in an increase in blood flow and an erection.

Prompt:  S3644 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3644 is a drug that targets the purine salvage pathway and acts as an inhibitor of ADA, which is responsible for the conversion of adenosine to inosine. Both deoxycoformycin (dCF) and S3644 are purine analogs that bind to the enzyme ADA and inhibit the formation of inosine from adenosine, resulting in accumulation of the purine nucleoside adenosine. These nucleosides, when deaminated, become purine bases that can then be incorporated into DNA and RNA by the host cell\'s RNA polymerase machinery. Both compounds are effective in the treatment of HIV infection by inhibiting viral replication, and S3644 is being evaluated in combination with zidovudine (AZT) in a phase I/II study.

Prompt:  S3656 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3656 is a drug that targets the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis ([@B8]). When given to apoE-KO mice, S3656 increases serum HDL and decreases LDL levels ([@B12]). However, despite its cholesterol-lowering effect, S3656 does not appear to alter plaque size in apoE-KO mice fed a high-fat diet ([@B9]). Although S3656 can decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in humans ([@B15]), its effect on plaque size is less than optimal. In our study, S3656 had no effect on total plaque size, but significantly decreased plaque collagen content, which was associated with increased plaque necrosis and increased plaque calcification.

Prompt:  S3657 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3657 is a drug that targets a protein, cofilin, which regulates actin filament dynamics. When actin filaments are severed by the drug, they are more likely to polymerize and produce lamellipodia. The drug has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis in animals, and has been tested in a Phase II clinical trial. It is now in Phase III clinical trials.

In addition to S3657, there are other experimental drugs that target actin polymerization, including the Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666 and a compound called pyrazofurin.

Prompt:  S3662 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3662 is a drug that targets a protein called E-cadherin, which is a component of cell-cell adhesion junctions. It is approved in the US for use in certain types of breast cancer. It was previously known as T-DM1, or trastuzumab emtansine, and is marketed under the brand name Kadcyla.

The US FDA has approved a revised label for the drug. It now warns that S3662 can cause severe and potentially fatal intestinal perforations, a rare but serious side effect. It says the risk increases when S3662 is combined with other drugs that can damage the lining of the gut, such as the chemotherapy agent irinotecan (also known as Camptosar).

Prompt:  S3663 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3663 is a drug that targets the E1A-stimulated activation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and is a promising anticancer agent. It is currently undergoing clinical trials in the USA and other countries. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of S3663 on the stability of the p53 protein and on the cell cycle distribution of MCF7 cells. S3663 induced p53 and p21(Cip1/Waf1) protein levels and caused cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase. The upregulation of p53 was dependent on the activity of ATM and ATR kinases. Inhibition of ATM and ATR kinases suppressed the induction of p53 and p21(Cip1/Waf1) protein levels by S3663. S3663-induced upregulation of p53 protein was reduced in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. These results suggest that S

Prompt:  S3664 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3664 is a drug that targets the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which plays a role in immune suppression. Inhibition of IDO1 can lead to increased T cell activation and thus an anti-tumor response. In the current study, we investigated the potential of S3664 in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. We found that S3664 was effective at reducing tumor growth, increasing tumor cell apoptosis, and increasing tumor infiltration by cytotoxic T cells. In a panel of mouse ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that the anti-tumor activity of S3664 was similar to the effect of IFN-gamma, an immune stimulant. In a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that S3664 had minimal activity. These results suggest that S3664 is a promising lead compound for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Prompt:  S3668 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3668 is a drug that targets the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway. It has been demonstrated that S3668 treatment reduces the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice and rats, with less bone loss and cartilage damage, compared to other agents ([@B11], [@B12]). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that S3668 prevents and ameliorates the bone loss and cartilage damage in ovariectomized mice and rats ([@B12]). Although S3668 was found to prevent the development of arthritis in these animal models, it is not known whether S3668 has any effects on the bone metabolism in humans.

In the present study, we found that S3668 treatment did not affect bone metabolism in Japanese RA patients. The reason for the absence of an effect of S3668 on bone metabolism is not known. However, it is possible that the effect of S3668 on bone metabolism may be small in humans because

Prompt:  S3681 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3681 is a drug that targets mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I and III. It has been tested in phase I and phase II clinical trials and is currently under investigation in a phase III trial in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ([@B42]; [@B35]; [@B39]; [@B36]). Unfortunately, this drug has shown no clinical benefit in phase III clinical trials, and thus its development was discontinued ([@B14]). The exact mechanism of action of S3681 is unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of S3681 on the interaction of BRCA1 with mitochondrial proteins and on the apoptotic response of breast cancer cells to BRCA1 depletion. We show that S3681 selectively binds to the BRCA1-RAD51 complex and to the BRCA1-UHRF1 complex. S3681 affects the assembly of BRCA1 with mitochondrial proteins

Response: S3685 is a drug that targets P2X7 receptor. S3685 has been shown to block the increase in intracellular Ca^2+^, inhibit the secretion of inflammatory mediators, and attenuate LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice.

In the present study, we showed that pretreatment with S3685 significantly attenuated the histopathological damage in the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mice, reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines in the lung tissues, and decreased the number of neutrophils in the BALF. These findings suggest that S3685 has protective effects against LPS-induced ALI, at least in part, by inhibiting the activation of the P2X7 receptor.

Prompt:  S3690 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3690 is a drug that targets the p53 pathway and induces apoptosis in cells with mutant p53. However, little is known about its antitumor efficacy and toxicological effects in vivo. We therefore evaluated the antitumor activity of S3690 in vivo. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, S3690 treatment showed antitumor activity in p53 mutant human HCT116 and HCT116 p53+/+ cell lines but not in the HCT116 p53-/- cell line. S3690 treatment significantly suppressed the growth of HCT116 xenografts. S3690 treatment caused G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 xenografts, as evidenced by a significant increase in the proportion of sub-G1 cells, decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and increased expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and p53.

Prompt:  S3694 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3694 is a drug that targets a mutant form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is found in many cancers. The drug also shows promise in a number of other cancer types, including colorectal, pancreatic, non-small cell lung, and triple-negative breast cancer.

S3694 is designed to target EGFRvIII, a mutant form of the receptor found in more than half of glioblastomas and some non-small cell lung cancers. EGFRvIII has been shown to promote tumor growth and is believed to contribute to the resistance of tumors to EGFR-targeted therapies.

The drug is administered as a once-daily oral pill.

While it’s the first FDA-approved drug to target EGFRvIII, the drug is not the first to target the receptor. Tarceva (erlotinib), another EGFR inhibitor, was the first drug to target the mutant

Prompt:  S3701 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3701 is a drug that targets the catalytic site of PARP1. Preclinical data has demonstrated that S3701 is an effective inhibitor of PARP1 and results in a reduction of PAR levels in cells. A single dose of S3701 in healthy human subjects results in a plasma concentration of approximately 10 μM and a PARP1 inhibition of approximately 50% for 24 hours.
In clinical trials, S3701 has demonstrated a pharmacological activity against tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), medulloblastoma, and anaplastic astrocytoma. In Phase 1 clinical trials, S3701 was administered as a single agent to patients with recurrent or progressive GBM, or anaplastic astrocytoma, and showed a favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties. The data from this study also suggested that S3701 has potential activity in patients with CNS tumors.

Prompt:  S3703 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3703 is a drug that targets protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and has been used in cancer treatment. However, its anticancer mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that S3703 induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. We further found that the induction of apoptosis by S3703 was mediated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3. In addition, the inhibition of Akt activation with a dominant negative mutant Akt-S1726F or a pharmacological inhibitor of Akt abolished the S3703-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. These findings indicate that S3703-induced apoptosis is dependent on Akt activation and that the inhibition of Akt activation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.

Prompt:  S3705 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3705 is a drug that targets a cytoplasmic, non-receptor tyrosine kinase known as fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The ligand for FGFR2 is fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). In healthy cells, FGF-2 is inactive and has an affinity for heparin, while FGFR2 is inactive when bound to heparin. In pathological conditions, such as cancer, FGF-2 binds to heparin and becomes active, activating the FGFR2 and leading to proliferation and angiogenesis. A compound that binds to FGFR2, prevents binding of FGF-2 and, thus, leads to the inhibition of FGFR2 and subsequent growth arrest.
S3705 is a low molecular weight compound and is a potent inhibitor of FGFR2, with an IC50 of about 1 nM in the enzymatic assay. The binding affinity of S

Using AD mice models expressing human APP695, the main cause of AD, we observed that S3706 could improve their cognitive deficits. Moreover, S3706 increased amyloid-β levels and reduced amyloid-β-induced oxidative stress and tau phosphorylation. In addition, S3706 reduced APP processing, suppressed APP-C99-induced neurotoxicity, and decreased the production of amyloid-β. Moreover, S3706 promoted neurite outgrowth and inhibited Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis. S3706 also rescued the synaptic impairment caused by Aβ in the brain of AD mice. Moreover, S3706 significantly improved synaptic plasticity and enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. These results

Prompt:  S3711 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3711 is a drug that targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in cells, with reported IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. As a result of this high affinity, S3711 is a potent inhibitor of the chaperone activity of Hsp90, and of a number of other cellular proteins. The identification of these proteins may allow the development of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of diseases associated with misfolded proteins.

**Methods**: We developed a screening assay that measures the ATPase activity of Hsp90. The activity of Hsp90 is strongly inhibited by S3711, and its effects on the ATPase activity are dose-dependent. We validated this assay using purified Hsp90 and ATP and applied it to the screen of a panel of kinase inhibitors and natural product extracts.

Prompt:  S3718 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3718 is a drug that targets the key elements of the molecular mechanism of cancer, and also functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. We used both in vitro and in vivo models to examine the anti-cancer activity of S3718 in breast cancer. S3718 treatment in vitro was associated with increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The molecular mechanism underlying S3718 activity is through inhibition of the Src-STAT3 signaling pathway. S3718 treatment in vivo resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft models. Our results suggest that S3718 is a promising agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

Prompt:  S3719 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3719 is a drug that targets caspase-1, which is known to be a mediator of the inflammasome, an important pathway in inflammation. In this study, the authors show that S3719 treatment decreases proinflammatory cytokine production in both the peritoneal cavity and the brain. They show that caspase-1 is required for the induction of the proinflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal cavity. This effect was also observed in the brain and may be due to the role of caspase-1 in microglial cells. S3719 treatment also leads to increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, which can also contribute to inflammation. The study is interesting, but the experiments do not clearly show that caspase-1 activation is the only way to induce inflammation in the brain. Although the caspase-1 inhibition can reduce inflammation in the peritoneal cavity, it is possible that caspase-1 is not

Sulfonamide compounds such as S3720 inhibit farnesyltransferase and in this study we investigate the effect of these compounds on cell migration and proliferation. We found that S3720 reduces the migration of a number of KRAS-mutant cancer cell lines, including SW620 (KRAS G13D), A549 (KRAS G12C), and HCT116 (KRAS G13D). The effect on migration was observed at S3720 concentrations that did not significantly affect cell proliferation. In addition, we found that S3720 decreases the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β in a KRAS-dependent manner. These results indicate that

Prompt:  S3721 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3721 is a drug that targets the DNA repair enzyme PARP-1 and induces a synthetic lethality phenotype in tumors that have defective DNA repair, such as breast cancer. To understand the mechanism of this synthetic lethality, we developed a series of genetically engineered cell lines that stably express a cDNA encoding wild-type or mutant PARP-1. We found that PARP-1 binds directly to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. We also found that PARP-1 binds specifically to regions of the XRCC1 gene that are required for efficient DNA repair. In cells that lack XRCC1, PARP-1-induced cell death requires XRCC1 and does not occur in cells that express a mutant XRCC1 protein that fails to bind DNA. We conclude that PARP-1 is an obligate partner for XRCC1 and is activated by XRCC1 in a sequence-specific manner to repair DNA damage.

Prompt:  S3726 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3726 is a drug that targets the proteasome, an intracellular protein degradation pathway that plays a key role in cancer cell growth. The high activity of the proteasome in cancer cells is due to overexpression of the beta 5 subunit of the proteasome. We have recently demonstrated that treatment of colon cancer cells with S3726 induces apoptosis and causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in S3726-treated cells. Inhibition of the JNK pathway with a pharmacological inhibitor or small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked the ROS accumulation and apoptosis induced by S3726. The apoptosis caused by S3726 was significantly inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun, which inhibits the JNK pathway. Moreover, the apoptosis induced by S3726 was markedly

Response: S3727 is a drug that targets the ADP/ATP translocase (ANT) in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of S3727 in various animal models of metabolic disorders. S3727 at 1 mg/kg/day for 5 days by oral administration in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and S3727 at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 10 days by intraperitoneal injection in leptin-deficient obese ob/ob mice significantly improved HFD-induced insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and liver steatosis. These results were confirmed in the case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by a high-fat diet and by an ob/ob mouse model.

Prompt:  S3728 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3728 is a drug that targets microtubule (MT) dynamics and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. While there is evidence that paclitaxel and S3728 can enhance the activity of TRAIL against breast cancer cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not understood. In this study, we show that the combination of S3728 and TRAIL induces anoikis in breast cancer cells. This was accompanied by enhanced levels of phospho-paxillin and phospho-paxillin-paxillin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of Src family kinases. We also show that paclitaxel and S3728 can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by disrupting MT dynamics. These results suggest that the enhanced cytotoxicity of S3728 in combination with TRAIL is, at least in part, due to disruption of cell-cell adhesion

Prompt:  S3729 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3729 is a drug that targets the protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the gastrointestinal tract and liver and reduces the absorption of a wide variety of drugs. It is in development by Elan Corporation for the treatment of opioid overdose.

Efficacy

Efficacy has been established in a single Phase II trial of S3729 in patients suffering from opioid overdose. In this trial, the overdose drug was morphine and the patients were given S3729 at a dose of 50 mg (20 mg/kg) i.v. S3729 significantly increased the clearance of morphine and increased the time to first sign of respiratory depression. The effect was significant for at least 6 hours. This effect is similar to the effects of the known P-gp inhibitors, cyclosporine and PSC833.

Adverse effects

A Phase I trial of S3729 was conducted in healthy volunteers. The most common adverse effects were mild

Prompt:  S3735 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3735 is a drug that targets caspase-3 and caspase-7, two members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases that have important roles in apoptosis. This drug is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of several types of cancer. Here, we investigate the effects of this drug on mitochondria and mitochondria-associated events during apoptosis. We show that S3735 causes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, in a dose-dependent manner. These changes are accompanied by a marked activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, as well as by the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Interestingly, caspase activation by S3735 occurs in the absence of cell death. Taken together, these results show that S3735 induces apoptosis by a caspase-independent mechanism.

Prompt:  S3742 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3742 is a drug that targets Src kinase, which is a protein kinase known to be involved in multiple signaling pathways. It has been shown to have potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. However, it is also associated with dose-limiting toxicity. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of the two drugs in two different xenograft models. Treatment with S3742 (5 mg/kg) alone or in combination with the topoisomerase inhibitor, doxorubicin (2 mg/kg), was tested in two murine xenograft models, in which the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was injected subcutaneously in SCID mice and in which the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1 was injected intravenously. Tumor growth was measured and mice were followed for the appearance of toxic effects. Both drugs alone caused significant inhibition of tumor growth in both models.

Response: S3746 is a drug that targets and down-regulates the expression of fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα) ([@bib16]). In fact, S3746 has been developed as a potential anti-cancer drug, because it down-regulates FAPα in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. As such, S3746 was found to be safe for use in patients with advanced cancers ([@bib16]). In a phase I clinical trial, patients with advanced cancer received intravenous infusions of S3746 at 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg once a week.

Prompt:  S3754 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3754 is a drug that targets the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which is an enzyme that inactivates serotonin.

There are two main reasons that scientists are interested in MAO-B: first, it plays a role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters in the brain; second, it is responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters in the brain. In the brain, serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is important in regulating mood, learning, memory, and other brain functions. In people with depression, serotonin levels are too low.

The MAO-B inhibitor, S3754, helps to increase serotonin levels in the brain, which is what causes it to work to help improve mood.

To examine the mechanism of action of S3758 in cancer cells, we performed a series of *in vitro* studies to investigate its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle. We treated the four cancer cell lines with increasing concentrations of S3758 for 48 h and then measured cell viability. As shown in Figure [2A](#F2){ref-type="fig"}, S3758 treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in all four cell lines. Cell viability decreased by as much as 85% in cells treated with 20 μM S3758. S3758 was

Response: S3766 is a drug that targets specific surface antigens on MSCs. It has been used to eliminate Treg cells to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs \[[@B83-ijms-20-03004]\].

MSCs can be infected with lentiviral vectors to express anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, TGF-β, and IL-4. The introduction of these cytokines into MSCs has been shown to improve the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs in a rat model of acute GVHD \[[@B84-ijms-20-03004]\]. The transplantation of anti-inflammatory cytokine-transduced MSCs reduced GVHD severity in a mouse model of acute GVHD \[[@B85-ijms-20-03004]\]. These results indicate that MSCs can be genetically modified to express

Prompt:  S3769 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3769 is a drug that targets the p53-MDM2 interaction.

In summary, although the MDM2 inhibitors have shown promise as a new class of anticancer agents, they also cause a host of side effects that limit their use in clinical trials. Furthermore, they are not ideal for combination therapy because they block both the p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways, and they are toxic to the cells with a wild-type p53. The p53-independent apoptotic pathway also causes undesirable side effects because the proapoptotic proteins are not specific to cancer cells. This is because the proteins that are induced by p53 also have important functions in normal cells. As a result, it is clear that MDM2 inhibitors need to be improved if they are to be effective anticancer agents.

Prompt:  S3770 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3770 is a drug that targets ribosomal protein L1 (RPL1) and the ribosomal protein L23 (RPL23), two of the essential ribosomal proteins involved in protein synthesis. S3770 is a pro-drug that is converted into a tripeptide, S3(H), which is released from the ribosome and enters the cytoplasm, where it is degraded into the corresponding amino acids by the peptidase, S3P. These amino acids can be reused to form proteins in the cytoplasm and/or incorporated into new proteins in the mitochondria.

Ribosomal protein L1 and L23 are essential for protein synthesis, and mutations in these genes cause multiple ribosomopathies. S3770 is the first ribosomal protein inhibitor to be identified.

Prompt:  S3772 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3772 is a drug that targets the F1 ATPase of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex. The F1 ATPase is composed of the α, β, and γ subunits and is required for the production of ATP through the process of OXPHOS. This process is initiated by the reduction of cytochrome c in the electron transport chain. When reduced, cytochrome c is then transferred to the OXPHOS complex. Cytochrome c is then oxidized and the electron transport chain is activated. Activation of the electron transport chain leads to the production of ATP through the process of OXPHOS. Inhibition of the F1 ATPase, therefore, leads to the depletion of ATP and, consequently, a disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.

In mammalian cells, the F1 ATPase complex is composed of three subunits:

Response: S3775 is a drug that targets the F-box protein Skp2 and inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor p27Kip1 \[[@R36]\]. When we examined the effects of HCFU-S3775 on cell proliferation and survival, we found that HCFU-S3775 effectively blocked the growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure [5A](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). Moreover, HCFU-S3775 treatment caused a marked accumulation of p27Kip1 in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate epithelial cells (Figure [5B](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). Interestingly, HCFU-S3775 treatment increased the levels of p27Kip1 in both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) prostate cancer cells (Figure [5

Prompt:  S3779 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3779 is a drug that targets VDAC1 and induces cell death by apoptosis in cancer cells. For example, S3779 has been shown to induce cell death in pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, colon, breast, lung, and glioblastoma cells in vitro \[[@CR54]--[@CR59]\]. The pro-apoptotic activity of S3779 is due to its ability to bind to VDAC1 \[[@CR60]\]. The identification of VDAC1 as a drug target was recently shown to have important implications for the development of a new generation of anticancer drugs \[[@CR61]\]. The link between cancer and mitochondrial dysfunction has been established in many types of cancers, and targeting the VDAC1 channel is a promising strategy to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to treatment.

Prompt:  S3783 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3783 is a drug that targets HIV-1 RT in order to prevent the incorporation of the viral RNA into the viral DNA chain, thus preventing the HIV-1 life cycle. This drug acts in a reverse transcriptase-independent manner and in order to overcome the drug resistance problem, S3783 was developed as a combination therapy with other reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and abacavir (ABC) \[[@B101-viruses-10-00135]\]. In addition, S3783 is effective against various clinical isolates of HIV-1, even when the virus is resistant to other reverse transcriptase inhibitors \[[@B102-viruses-10-00135]\]. This indicates that S3783 can be a good option for the treatment of HIV-1 infections, but the real efficacy of this drug has yet to be determined in humans.

Prompt:  S3785 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3785 is a drug that targets the ATP-binding domain of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) reverse transcriptase. It is a potent inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of the reverse transcriptase, and inhibits viral replication at an early stage of the viral life cycle. The drug has a long half-life, is orally active and, in addition to its anti-viral activity, exhibits immunomodulatory effects in vitro. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of S3785 in monkeys were examined. S3785 was orally administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg to male cynomolgus monkeys. Plasma samples were collected for measurement of the drug concentration at different time points, and its pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. S3785 was absorbed rapidly after oral administration. Its plasma concentration declined in a bi-exponential manner. The absorption half-life was approximately 2.0 h, and the absorption time

Prompt:  S3794 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3794 is a drug that targets and blocks an essential function of the caspase family of cysteine proteases and is an attractive candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The rationale for developing S3794 is that the selective inhibition of the activity of the effector caspases would block the death-signaling cascade in cells that are undergoing apoptosis. As a result, S3794 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and conditions.
For example, S3794 has been shown to be efficacious in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), ischemia, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, the efficacy of S3794 has been shown in preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes.

Prompt:  S3807 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3807 is a drug that targets a complex of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. It has a high specificity to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and no effect on the expression of genes related to cell cycle or apoptosis. Its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In the current study, the activity of S3807 was assessed by examining its effect on the proliferation of various tumor cell lines, including ERK1/2-dependent cell lines, ERK1/2-independent cell lines, and primary breast cancer cells. The anti-tumor effects of S3807 on tumor xenografts were also assessed. S3807 showed a strong inhibition of the proliferation of ERK1/2-dependent tumor cell lines, but had little effect on the proliferation of ERK1/2-independent cell lines.

Prompt:  S3810 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3810 is a drug that targets the E2F1 transcription factor, and inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. We used QS-3810 to treat two patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft models, which represent the two most common molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. We found that QS-3810 was effective in both models, with complete tumor regression observed in one model, and a significant reduction in tumor burden in the other. These findings support the development of QS-3810 for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States [1]. Treatment options for prostate cancer are limited, and novel therapeutic agents are needed. Recent studies have shown that E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, plays an important role in prostate cancer development and progression [2, 3]. E2F

Response: S3811 is a drug that targets AMPA receptors. It was developed by Sanofi, and is currently in phase II clinical trials. It was named TEN-002.

History

In the 1990s, GABAA receptor subunit 2 (GABRA2) and GABRA3 were discovered.  GABRA2 and GABRA3 were both initially discovered as a protein, but were later shown to be encoded by separate genes.  It was subsequently shown that these genes, which encode the alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunits, respectively, of the GABAA receptor, are highly homologous, and thus the alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunits are identical proteins.  A drug that targets the alpha-2 subunit would have similar effects as a drug that targets the alpha-3 subunit.  The drug was initially named GABRA2.  After it was determined that it is encoded by the GAB

Prompt:  S3817 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3817 is a drug that targets the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH7. UbcH7 mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to target proteins. UbcH7 can be activated by E1 (UbcH7), which transfers the ubiquitin molecule from an E2-ubiquitin thioester intermediate to the target protein. The E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH7 is a general mediator of protein ubiquitination, and it has been demonstrated that this enzyme is overexpressed in many cancer cell lines, and it is required for cell growth.
Ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating the functions of many proteins involved in cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. There is a significant correlation between the ubiquitination of a protein and the protein's role in cell growth. Ubiquitination is often associated with the degradation of the

Prompt:  S3821 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3821 is a drug that targets the binding of PIM kinases to the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. We show that this compound induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with varying sensitivity to the related PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208. Moreover, S3821 induced the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the cells, indicating the induction of apoptosis. In addition, the induction of apoptosis by S3821 was correlated with downregulation of phosphorylated AKT, upregulation of p21, and upregulation of p27. S3821 also induced the expression of PTEN, p53, and the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. S3821 also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in two lung cancer cell lines that were resistant to AZD1208. These data suggest that S3821 may be a

Prompt:  S3824 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3824 is a drug that targets the EGF receptor (EGFR). It was designed to inhibit the TK activity of EGFR by binding to the ATP binding pocket of the TK domain. The pharmacokinetic profile of S3824 in healthy male subjects showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of S3824 was 4.2-fold greater than that of cetuximab, and the maximal concentration (Cmax) was 1.8-fold greater than that of cetuximab. The systemic exposure of S3824 was comparable to that of cetuximab, suggesting that the affinity of S3824 for EGFR is comparable to that of cetuximab. In addition, the affinity of S3824 for EGFR was confirmed in a biochemical binding assay. S3824 is a potent EGFR inhibitor with comparable EGFR affinity to cetuximab, and is a promising new agent for treating NSCL

Prompt:  S3835 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3835 is a drug that targets the MAPK pathway, and the S6K1/S6 axis is a downstream target of mTOR. We have already reported that MLN4924 inhibits tumor growth in PDAC cells by inhibiting mTOR, and that combined treatment with MLN4924 and an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin synergistically inhibits PDAC growth \[[@R13], [@R14]\].

Prompt:  S3839 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3839 is a drug that targets mitotic kinases, such as Aurora-B and Plk1, and inhibits cancer cell growth by disrupting the mitotic checkpoint \[[@B45-ijms-18-00785],[@B46-ijms-18-00785]\].

However, SW620 cells were more sensitive to S3839. These results suggest that S3839 may have more potency in the mitotic phase than the G2/M phase. This finding is consistent with a previous study, which demonstrated that S3839 induced mitotic arrest by inhibiting Aurora-B and Plk1 \[[@B46-ijms-18-00785]\].

Prompt:  S3842 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3842 is a drug that targets the Wnt signaling pathway. It is a synthetic analogue of the Wnt pathway inhibitor LGK-974, with a hydroxyl group added to the lactone ring of LGK-974. This modification confers high selectivity for inhibition of Wnt signaling and avoids the GI toxicity of LGK-974. This analog is being developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a form of cancer that is associated with the activation of the Wnt pathway. 

S3842 has shown promising preclinical data in the treatment of osteosarcoma, an aggressive form of bone cancer. In a mouse model of osteosarcoma, treatment with S3842 decreased tumor burden and significantly increased animal survival. S3842 has also shown promise in a mouse model of lymphoma. In that model, S3842 decreased tumor burden, increased survival, and reduced tumor size. S3842 is currently being tested

A recent study showed that S3843 treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo \[[@CR30]\]. This study also showed that the expression of TβRI in NSCLC cells was correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis. TβRI inhibition was associated with decreased expression of MMP2, MMP9, and the metastasis-associated genes in NSCLC cells. A phase II clinical trial in advanced NSCLC patients was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S38

Prompt:  S3846 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3846 is a drug that targets the spindle checkpoint, the process that holds a cell in mitosis until all the chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. In cancer cells, the spindle checkpoint is frequently broken, allowing cells to exit mitosis before they are fully attached to the mitotic spindle. This allows cells to divide with damaged DNA and often results in a greater number of genetic mutations.

“This is a really exciting study,” says Matthew Cook, Ph.D., a cell biologist at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “It suggests that a more direct approach to targeting spindle checkpoint components might be a promising new treatment for a variety of cancers.”

In this study, the researchers focused on S3846, a small molecule that inhibits the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2. They found that S3846 targets breast cancer cells and non-small cell lung cancer cells.

Prompt:  S3847 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3847 is a drug that targets G-quadruplex structures of telomeric DNA, which are recognized by the DNA damage response protein telomerase and causes telomere shortening, leading to cell death. Recently, it was shown that S3847 induces cell death by inducing the proteasome-dependent degradation of telomerase RNA (TERC) \[[@R9]\]. We observed that S3847 treatment causes accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, which could be detected in cells even after short-term treatment. To determine whether the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins is due to a defect in protein degradation, we measured the stability of these proteins. The polyubiquitinated proteins were markedly more stable than non-ubiquitinated proteins in S3847-treated cells. These results suggest that the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins is a general response to proteasome inhibition, and not a specific response to S38

Prompt:  S3849 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3849 is a drug that targets the non-toxic Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) by specifically binding to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 (Hsp90α). It was designed and developed by AbbVie. It was under development by AbbVie as a potential treatment for HIV infection and also for cancers. The development was discontinued in 2010 due to the lack of significant clinical benefit.

As of March 2015, it is in phase II clinical trials for treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Mechanism of action

Hsp90 inhibition

The mechanism of action of S3849 has not been fully elucidated, but its proposed mechanism of action involves inhibiting Hsp90, an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that is required for the correct folding, activation, and/or stability of many proteins.

S3849 is structurally similar to geldanamycin (GA)

Response: S3850 is a drug that targets the t-tubule membrane, and it has been used for studying t-tubule function \[[@b10-medscimonit-23-6072]\]. At the same time, we can use this drug to investigate the role of t-tubules in the development of HF, and to explore whether a reduction in the t-tubule membrane conductance can promote HF development. In this study, we found that HF patients have a significant reduction in t-tubule membrane conductance. We also found that both the increase in \[Ca^2+^\]~i~ induced by caffeine and the Ca^2+^ overload in the SR induced by ATP stimulation in cardiomyocytes isolated from HF patients were significantly greater than those in cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy volunteers. This result suggests that HF patients have an increase in Ca^2+^-induced Ca^2+^ release and SR Ca

Response: S3851 is a drug that targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of HCV infection. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral S3851 when administered to healthy adult subjects. The maximum tolerated dose of S3851 was not reached, and S3851 was well tolerated at all doses studied. The most common adverse events were mild to moderate nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache.

Although this trial was not designed to evaluate antiviral efficacy, it is notable that S3851 demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the reduction of HCV RNA at the end of treatment compared with placebo. The absence of an antiviral effect of S3851 was not unexpected, as HCV replicates in hepatocytes and the drug did not target the viral RNA polymerase directly.

Prompt:  S3856 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3856 is a drug that targets Src and inhibits proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells. We show that knockdown of Src in lung cancer cells reduced both basal and S3856-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3. Src knockdown also blocked the S3856-induced increase in cell-cycle progression. In addition, we found that Src was a direct target of S3856, and that S3856 treatment reduced Src kinase activity. Inhibition of Src kinase activity in NSCLC cells by S3856 resulted in a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3, and in cell-cycle progression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Src is a direct target of S3856, and that inhibition of Src kinase activity results in reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3, and reduced cell-cycle progression.

Introduction

Aberrant telomerase activity is a hallmark of human cancer. This enzyme is responsible for adding the repeated sequence (TTAGGG)n to the end of telomeres, which protects the ends of chromosomes from degradation and allows cells to proliferate.

There are several inhibitors of telomerase, such as Imetelstat, which is a drug used in clinical trials.

Although telomerase is found in stem cells and most cancers, it is not active in normal cells. This makes it an attractive target for the development of cancer treatments.

Chemical structure of Imetelstat

Imetelstat is an oligonucleotide that binds to the RNA component of telomerase, and thus prevents it from binding to the telomerase substrate.

This makes it an attractive drug to

Prompt:  S3861 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3861 is a drug that targets Src-family kinases and was shown to be a promising anti-cancer agent \[[@B30-ijms-20-01109]\]. Our data showed that Src and Yes inhibition by S3861 was more effective than by PP2. We suggest that S3861 targets Src family kinases more efficiently than PP2, and it may also target Yes more effectively than PP2. The Src family kinases play important roles in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and cell death \[[@B31-ijms-20-01109]\]. Therefore, targeting Src family kinases has been expected to provide novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of cancers.

Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of Src inhibitors in cancer cells. We have demonstrated that the antitumor effect of Src inhibitors may be due to both Src and

Prompt:  S3868 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3868 is a drug that targets the activation of Wnt signaling and is currently in clinical development for use in treating colon and pancreatic cancers. However, the efficacy of S3868 in a broad range of cancers remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of S3868 in a mouse model of lung cancer. Treatment with S3868 significantly suppressed the growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors in mice, whereas it had little effect on the growth of normal tissues. S3868 inhibited Wnt signaling in a Wnt-dependent manner, which was associated with a reduction in the expression of the stemness marker, Nanog. Furthermore, S3868 induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells and suppressed tumor growth by targeting both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The anti-tumor effect of S3868 was associated with a decrease in the expression of both P-gp and the multidrug resistance

Prompt:  S3887 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3887 is a drug that targets LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease, a rare, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder with a prevalence of about 1 in 100,000. The most common symptoms of Parkinson's disease are tremors, muscle rigidity, impaired balance and coordination, and difficulties with walking and speech. These symptoms can get progressively worse over time, and if left untreated, eventually lead to dementia. As LRRK2 is a gene that has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, it is a very attractive drug target.

In a recent study, published in Science Translational Medicine, researchers used an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify drugs that specifically target LRRK2. LRRK2 is an enzyme that is responsible for the phosphorylation of many proteins in the cell, and the researchers hoped that inhibiting this activity could have therapeutic benefits.

Prompt:  S3889 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3889 is a drug that targets the molecular mechanism of growth, division and metastasis of tumor cells. It is the only FDA-approved anti-tumor drug for GIST, and the clinical response rate of imatinib has been reported to be 80-90% in the treatment of GISTs. Although imatinib is a highly effective drug, drug resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of GISTs. We previously showed that imatinib resistance is associated with the occurrence of *c-kit* mutations in KIT exon 13 and 17 \[[@R1]\].

Prompt:  S3892 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3892 is a drug that targets the arginine deiminase pathway. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of arginine to citrulline and ornithine. When it is inhibited, there is less citrulline production, which results in an increase in arginine availability. When arginine is present, the enzyme will deaminate it to citrulline. Arginine is an important precursor of polyamines, which are essential for cell proliferation. Polyamines can also be used as an energy source for tumor cells, so the presence of arginine in a tumor can be a source of energy for these cells. Because of the importance of the arginine deiminase pathway in cancer cells, arginine deiminase (ADI) has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. ADI is also involved in other processes such as wound healing, and inhibition of this pathway has been shown to increase wound healing.

It was recently shown that S3909 can be delivered into cancer cells using both cationic liposomes and peptide-based nanocarriers.^[@cit47]^ To study the effect of the nanocarrier on the DNA G4 binding ability of S3909, we titrated S3909 with a 1 : 1 ratio of the nanocarrier to S3909 and then performed gel-shift assay ([Fig. 4b](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}). The gel-shift assay was carried out in the presence of increasing amounts of nanocarrier to determine the *K* ~d~ of S3909--nanocarrier interaction. In the presence of 100 μM of nanocarrier, the *K* ~d~ of S3909--nanocarrier interaction was found to

Prompt:  S3919 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3919 is a drug that targets STAT3 and inhibits cell proliferation and migration in various cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of the combination of ADR and S3919 on the growth of human gastric cancer cells. In vivo tumor growth and in vitro drug sensitivity were evaluated in gastric cancer cells treated with ADR, S3919, and ADR+S3919. Apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell death were evaluated. We found that S3919 potentiated the cytotoxicity of ADR in gastric cancer cells. The combination treatment induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell death in a synergistic manner. The combination of ADR and S3919 also enhanced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. We concluded that S3919 potentiated the cytotoxicity of ADR in gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway and enhancing the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.

Prompt:  S3923 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3923 is a drug that targets the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, GAPDH, and has been used to treat a number of types of cancer including multiple myeloma and leukemia. This compound has also been used as an adjuvant to reduce the tumor burden in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. We investigated the potential for S3923 to inhibit the growth of HNSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. S3923 inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner with GI50 values of 1.2-1.9 μM in a panel of HNSCC cell lines. This growth inhibition was due to G1 arrest as indicated by flow cytometry analysis. In contrast, the HNSCC cell lines tested were sensitive to the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), with GI50 values of 0.05-0.15 mM. The combination of 2DG and S3923

Prompt:  S3924 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3924 is a drug that targets the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. It has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in vivo. Here, we evaluated the anticancer activity of S3924 in a wide panel of cancer cell lines. S3924 showed potent growth inhibition in vitro with GI50 values in the nanomolar range, regardless of their p53 status, and induced apoptosis in a subset of tumor cells, but not in normal cells. The anticancer activity of S3924 was also confirmed in vivo in a tumor xenograft model. Moreover, the growth of human tumor xenografts established in immunodeficient mice was strongly inhibited by S3924. The anticancer activity of S3924 in vivo was also confirmed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of human NSCLC. Taken together, our data suggest that S3924 is a promising anticancer agent with a novel mechanism of action.

Prompt:  S3925 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3925 is a drug that targets lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enzyme with critical roles in epigenetic regulation of genes. It has been found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of LSD1 in cancer cells and also a promising drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. S3925 has been demonstrated to have potential antitumor activity against various cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, colon, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers, as well as melanoma and leukemia.

S3925 is currently in clinical trials in patients with solid tumors, including advanced solid tumors, such as metastatic breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. S3925 is also being tested in combination with other therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Prompt:  S3926 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3926 is a drug that targets the proteasome and causes a decrease in protein turnover.

The potential use of S3926 in cancer has been explored in two separate studies. In one, it was used in combination with bortezomib to target bortezomib-resistant cells \[[@B50-ijms-21-00665]\]. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and although bortezomib has activity against most cancers, resistance to this drug can arise.

In the study by Gao et al., S3926 was used in combination with bortezomib to treat bortezomib-resistant cells, which is an interesting approach because this combination has not been previously explored. However, there are two important limitations to the study. Firstly, although the S3926/bortezomib combination decreased the growth of bort

Prompt:  S3927 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3927 is a drug that targets the Ras signaling pathway, and is a highly potent inhibitor of cell proliferation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of CGP 56849, a second-generation HSP90 inhibitor, on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by S3927 in human prostate cancer cells. In the proliferation assay, CGP 56849 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against DU145 and PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. S3927 treatment significantly induced apoptosis in DU145 and PC3 cells, as shown by flow cytometry. However, the effects of CGP 56849 were similar to those of S3927. CGP 56849 did not induce apoptosis in DU145 and PC3 cells, even when these cells were treated with S3927. We conclude that CGP 56849 has antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cells similar to those of S3927, but it does not induce apopt

Prompt:  S3930 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3930 is a drug that targets the serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE). It is a member of the tripeptide family of NE inhibitors, consisting of an acylated serine protease inhibitor and a proline-rich domain. We have used an in vivo assay to show that a proline-rich peptide (PRP) from the S3930 molecule, but not the serine protease inhibitor (SRP) alone, is responsible for its anti-NE activity. In this paper, we report the development of a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify PRP-like peptides that inhibit NE. This assay is based on the measurement of the release of the chromogenic substrate S-2238 from the NE-catalysed hydrolysis of S-2238. Using the HTS assay, we have identified several other PRP-like peptides. We have demonstrated that these PRP-like

Prompt:  S3946 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3946 is a drug that targets the L-type calcium channel, CaV1.2, and the sodium-calcium exchanger, NCX1. It was originally developed by Sanofi-Aventis and was approved by the FDA in 2001. In 2008, it was approved for the treatment of migraine in Europe.

The efficacy of this drug in migraine has been shown in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A Cochrane review of 10 studies involving 1610 patients found that triptans were significantly more effective than the control treatments for migraine with or without aura. However, the efficacy of S3946 in migraine was similar to that of the other triptans, with a response rate of 47.3% versus 49.4% for placebo and 46.7% for sumatriptan. The only difference was that it was more effective in treating the most common type of migraine, the throbbing type. Another study of 693

Prompt:  S3948 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3948 is a drug that targets the Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase complex, a key regulatory element in the cell cycle. It binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the Cdc2 subunit and is able to trap the cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase complex in the inactive state. The results of the present study indicate that S3948 does not inhibit BRCA1/BARD1-mediated ubiquitination of p53, suggesting that the action of S3948 is limited to the regulation of the cell cycle.

Prompt:  S3951 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3951 is a drug that targets EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and is in phase II clinical trials. We developed a new cell line to test the anti-cancer effects of the drug. This cell line was generated by transfecting the cells with a lentivirus containing a drug resistance gene (puromycin). This is a new approach to develop cell lines that can be used to test the effect of drugs.

In this case, the drug-resistant cell line showed a reduced rate of proliferation when compared to the parental cells. The drug-resistant cells showed reduced levels of phosphorylated EGFR. The cells were then treated with S3951, and we found that the proliferation of the drug-resistant cells was inhibited more than the parental cells.

The drug-resistant cell line showed reduced expression of proteins that are involved in cell proliferation. These results show that the drug-resistant cell line has a reduced rate of proliferation, reduced phosphory

Prompt:  S3953 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3953 is a drug that targets a mutation in the *BRAF* gene (V600E) in melanoma. This drug has shown great promise as a treatment for this cancer. However, only about 20% of melanoma patients are likely to benefit from this drug, since the *BRAF* mutation occurs in only 10--15% of melanomas. This small group of patients has a high probability of responding to the drug. If a biomarker is available, it could be used to identify patients who are likely to respond to the drug. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project includes the largest set of genomic data for any cancer, and includes clinical data. In this study, the authors used the TCGA data to identify biomarkers that can predict which patients will respond to the BRAF inhibitor. They found that there are six mutations that can predict whether a patient will respond to the drug. This study demonstrates the potential of the TCGA data for identifying

Prompt:  S3957 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3957 is a drug that targets microtubules by binding to the β-tubulin subunit. Tubulin is the major component of microtubules, and the formation of microtubules is essential for cell division. The microtubule cytoskeleton provides the tracks along which molecular motors transport cargo from one part of the cell to another. Therefore, microtubule-targeting agents are used to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, bacterial infections, parasitic infections, and cardiovascular diseases ([@B1]).

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans. The TB infection is a major cause of death worldwide, and the disease is becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains ([@B2]). Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new drugs to treat TB. To develop a new TB drug, a better understanding of the functions of TB proteins is required

Prompt:  S3959 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3959 is a drug that targets the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells and binds to phosphatidylserine (PS). It was designed to identify PS-rich domains on the cell surface. It is thought to be internalized through an interaction with PS, but it also interacts with other membrane proteins. Therefore, its effects on membrane organization are complex and difficult to predict. However, when tested on the same cell line as EPI-1847, S3959 did not induce clustering of the raft-associated protein, LAT, at the plasma membrane ([Fig. 5, A and B](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}). Furthermore, EPI-1847, which also interacts with PS, did not affect LAT clustering ([Fig. 5 C](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}). In contrast, when used at high concentration, S3959 caused a decrease in the cell surface levels of LAT and TfR ([

Prompt:  S3968 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3968 is a drug that targets cancer cells by increasing their metabolic stress. However, this drug is currently used only to treat cancer patients with few options. Thus, it is important to know how to optimize its use in combination with other drugs. In this study, we found that an apoptosis-inducing agent, ABT-737, increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to S3968 by increasing the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. In addition, we found that the induction of G2/M arrest by ABT-737 was a crucial event in the synergistic induction of apoptosis by S3968. In addition, we demonstrated that this induction of G2/M arrest by ABT-737 was mediated by inhibition of Cdc25C phosphatase and activation of Wee1 kinase. Taken together, these findings indicate that the combination of ABT-737 and S3968 is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients.

Prompt:  S3969 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3969 is a drug that targets the M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) isozyme of the enzyme that is essential for glycolysis and proliferation of cancer cells. We studied the effects of S3969 on cell cycle progression and cell death in the lung cancer cell line A549. S3969 increased apoptosis in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner and caused G2/M arrest, as evidenced by the accumulation of cells in G2/M. S3969 induced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 and increased the levels of Bax and Bak, while Bcl-2 levels were not affected.

Methionine is converted to SAM (S-adenosylmethionine), the universal methyl donor, by the action of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is produced by the hydrolysis of SAM by SAH hydrolase (SAHH). SAH is an inhibitor of MAT and is converted to homocysteine by the action of SAH hydrolase. Homocysteine is then remethylated to methionine by the action of methionine synthase (MS). The methionine is converted to SAM by the action of methionine adenosyltransferase. The role of S3980 in methionine metabolism is to inhibit SAHH activity. The increase in SA

Prompt:  S3984 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3984 is a drug that targets and inhibits the activation of MEK and the downstream signaling of the MAPK pathway. In this study, we have found that S3984 can induce apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines, and that the combination of S3984 with cisplatin can significantly increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in vitro. The mechanisms underlying this effect include the inhibition of cell cycle progression, activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, inhibition of Akt signaling and induction of ER stress. This study provides evidence that the combination of S3984 with cisplatin can induce synergistic antitumor effects in NSCLC cells, and suggests that this combination is a promising treatment option for NSCLC.

Prompt:  S3987 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3987 is a drug that targets the tubulin depolymerizing agent colchicine. When given as a single dose, S3987 reverses colchicine-induced inhibition of spermatogenesis and reverses spermatogenic damage in male mice. In humans, a single dose of S3987 is able to reverse spermatogenic damage in men with reversible infertility secondary to testicular toxicity.

Introduction

Testicular toxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, vinblastine, and paclitaxel, have been shown to produce testicular toxicity in both rats and humans. Chemotherapy-induced testicular toxicity may manifest as azoospermia or decreased sperm count, which in severe cases may result in infertility.

The development of a drug that is able to reverse the effects of testicular toxicity would be useful in both

Prompt:  S3992 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3992 is a drug that targets the binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) of glucocorticoid responsive genes and thereby inhibits their expression. It is approved by FDA as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, its side effects such as bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and mood disorders have limited its clinical application. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist GSK2269552, a novel and potent derivative of GSK3789272, in the treatment of CTCL. We found that GSK2269552 inhibited the proliferation of CTCL cells and induced apoptosis, as determined by MTT, colony formation, and apoptosis assays.

Prompt:  S3996 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3996 is a drug that targets the putative adenosine receptor, GPR18 (also known as ADORA2A) and is under investigation for the treatment of depression. GPR18 is highly expressed in the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, and is also expressed in a subset of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The S3996 mechanism of action is not well understood. We used electrophysiological recordings in the striatum to study the pharmacological properties of S3996. Here we demonstrate that S3996 reduces spontaneous firing of GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons, but does not alter the spontaneous firing of glutamatergic neurons. The inhibition of GABAergic neurons by S3996 was blocked by adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261, but not by A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of S3996 is mediated through A2A receptors.

Prompt:  S3997 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S3997 is a drug that targets the intracellular domain of TNF receptor-1. The anti-inflammatory activity of this drug is considered to be mediated by inhibition of TNF-α, but the exact mechanism is not yet known. However, we have shown that S3997 inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 in human PBMCs. Since p38 and ERK are known to play an important role in the regulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, S3997 may exert its anti-inflammatory effect by downregulating the expression of these cytokines.

As S3997 has a chemical structure similar to that of fluticasone propionate, it may also act as a corticosteroid. However, it has been shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of S3997 is stronger than that of fluticasone propionate \[[@CR26]

Prompt:  S4002 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4002 is a drug that targets p53, a tumour suppressor protein that can regulate the expression of various genes that control the cell cycle. p53 has also been found to be a tumour suppressor in many cancers. p53 also functions to control the expression of many genes, including genes involved in apoptosis. Therefore, p53 is a very important gene for cell cycle control, and apoptosis. p53 is also a transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 is therefore a very important protein for the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Mdm2 is a negative regulator of p53, and has been shown to be overexpressed in many human cancers. Therefore, it has been a target for drug development.

Prompt:  S4117 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4117 is a drug that targets the angiotensin receptor-1. Angiotensin receptor-1 is known to be involved in the control of arterial blood pressure and body fluid balance. This molecule has a high affinity for the Angiotensin II receptor. By binding to the Angiotensin II receptor, S4117 reduces the level of the neuropeptide Angiotensin II in the brain, and consequently, it increases the level of dopamine in the brain. As a result, it is expected that S4117 may act as a dopamine receptor antagonist. S4117 has been found to be effective in the treatment of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In addition, it has been shown to improve sleep and to have anti-depressive effects in patients with Parkinson's disease. The molecule is orally active and is metabolized in the liver.

Prompt:  S4556 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4556 is a drug that targets cancer cells and has shown promise in several studies. For example, S4556 is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial to treat patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) identifier: NCT01804417).

The mechanism by which S4556 inhibits the growth of cancer cells is currently unknown. In the present study, we have identified that S4556 induces an acute response in the TSC, which is followed by a chronic response in the TSC and a compensatory response in the HSC. The acute and chronic responses are mediated by the TORC1 complex, whereas the compensatory response is mediated by the TORC2 complex.

Our study shows that S4556 is a novel and highly effective drug for the treatment of cancer.

Prompt:  S4565 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4565 is a drug that targets lysosomes. In normal cells, the acidic pH of the lysosomes induces an increase in the activity of lysosomal acid lipase, which breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. By inhibiting this process, S4565 causes the accumulation of triglycerides inside the cell. This causes an increase in the cell's internal acidity, which can trigger apoptosis.[@R24]

S4565 inhibits the lipolytic activity of the lysosome by binding to lysosomal acid lipase. The drug binds to the enzyme in a site distinct from the active site and inhibits its activity by causing an increase in the enzyme's Km value for triglycerides. The drug is administered orally, and achieves high blood levels in less than two hours.[@R25]

Prompt:  S4566 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4566 is a drug that targets the enzyme called cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). It works by blocking the action of the enzyme and preventing it from activating its target protein, causing the cells to become more sensitive to the signals of the hormone. This hormone is released by the hypothalamus and is responsible for causing the body to produce and release more growth hormone when the person is under stress. The symptoms of Cushing's disease are caused by an increase in the level of the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal gland. The level of cortisol is kept in check by a feedback mechanism that sends a signal to the pituitary gland to stop producing more of it. However, in Cushing's disease, the feedback mechanism is faulty and this leads to the level of cortisol being higher than normal.

What is the cure for Cushing's disease?

Cushing's disease is a condition that is treated by stopping the production of cortisol.

Prompt:  S4574 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4574 is a drug that targets microtubule assembly. Although the IC50 of tubulin assembly inhibition of TK3 is \>100 μM, TK3 inhibits microtubule assembly at a concentration of 100 nM. In contrast, TK3 does not inhibit the assembly of purified tubulin (Fig. S5), suggesting that TK3 inhibits microtubule assembly by interacting with the tubulin heterodimer.

The NMR spectra of TK3 with tubulin showed a line broadening of the H-α resonances of tubulin, suggesting that the binding of TK3 to tubulin changes the conformation of tubulin ([Fig. 4 A](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of S4576 as a monotherapy in a lung cancer xenograft model. S4576 was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a dose-escalation study in mice with a mouse lung cancer xenograft. S4576 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition and increased tumor cell apoptosis, which was reflected by elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase 9. However, S4576 monotherapy was not able to significantly inhibit tumor growth, as compared to vehicle treatment. Further analysis revealed that S4576 treatment resulted in an increase in circulating BMP9 levels. This study indicates that S45

Prompt:  S4582 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4582 is a drug that targets the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway. In addition to its effect on fibroblasts, this drug also has anti-angiogenic properties. Preclinical and clinical data support its use for patients with metastatic cancer. A phase I trial of a combination of CX-4945 with pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 23% of patients. This trial did not demonstrate a response rate greater than 20%, and the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. A phase II trial of CX-4945 combined with gemcitabine and erlotinib in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated a median overall survival of 9.4 months and a 1-year survival rate of 41%. This trial also demonstrated the potential for this drug to produce

Prompt:  S4583 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4583 is a drug that targets the activity of Rho-family GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) and is currently in phase II clinical trials for various cancers. Although several studies have shown that S4583 can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, the mechanisms by which it exerts these effects remain unclear. Here, we show that S4583 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through the induction of mitotic catastrophe. S4583 treatment induced high levels of cyclin B1, p21, p27, and the activation of cdc2. In addition, S4583 treatment caused microtubule disruption and the formation of multipolar spindles, which in turn resulted in chromosome misalignment and the accumulation of cells in mitosis. These data demonstrate that S4583 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitotic catastrophe by

Prompt:  S4584 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4584 is a drug that targets IKK and has shown great promise as an anti-inflammatory therapy for a number of inflammatory conditions. In the current study, we show that S4584 ameliorates the disease symptoms of TNFα-induced arthritis (TIA) in mice and that this protection is associated with reduced inflammation, improved cartilage repair, and improved bone formation. Importantly, we show that S4584 protects against TIA in a way that is independent of the major anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. S4584 treatment did not reduce the amount of IL-10 produced by draining lymph node cells from arthritic mice, but did increase IL-10 expression in arthritic mice. This increase in IL-10 expression is associated with improved repair of damaged cartilage and bone. These results show that S4584 is a potent and selective inhibitor of IKK that can prevent inflammation and promote repair in an IL-10-independent manner. These

Prompt:  S4588 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4588 is a drug that targets Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in order to induce apoptosis. Its most potent effects were observed in breast cancer cells. This drug is now in clinical trials for a number of types of cancer. It was also used to treat a patient with CLL who had failed all other therapies. He showed a complete response lasting for at least 6 years.[@b53-btt-6-203]

MCL-1 is a survival protein and antiapoptotic protein. It is overexpressed in a number of hematological malignancies, including CLL.[@b54-btt-6-203] It is thought that this is due to a "self-renewal" mechanism. The expression of MCL-1 can be inhibited by the use of BH3-mimetics, which will be discussed later.

Prompt:  S4590 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4590 is a drug that targets a site of proteolysis in HIV-1. When the drug is added to the culture medium, it binds to the HIV-1 protease, which is present in newly synthesized virions, and thus prevents the cleavage of Gag and Gag-Pol precursors. Thus, virions produced in the presence of S4590 are noninfectious and contain a large amount of the non-processed Gag precursor \[[@B26-viruses-07-02938]\]. As shown in [Figure 2](#viruses-07-02938-f002){ref-type="fig"}, infection of MT-2 cells by wild-type HIV-1 resulted in an increase of the p24 Gag content in the culture medium, and this increase was suppressed by the addition of S4590. However, infection of the cells by the S4590-resistant HIV-1 NL4-3

Prompt:  S4594 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4594 is a drug that targets the RNA binding domain of ITAFs. ITAFs are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins that play a role in the processing of mRNAs. One of the ITAFs, named polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTB1), is expressed in a variety of cancers. This protein is known to be essential for the stability of some mRNAs and it has been shown to be important for the progression of multiple myeloma. In this study, we show that S4594 induces growth arrest and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Treatment of cells with S4594 resulted in accumulation of PTB1, followed by induction of p53, activation of the pro-apoptotic Bax, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Interestingly, S4594 treatment also caused the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1. Finally, we show that PTB

Prompt:  S4600 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4600 is a drug that targets the NF-κB signalling pathway. It is a non-competitive inhibitor of IκB kinase (IKK) complex that prevents IKK activation and IκB phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB translocation into the nucleus. It is a first-in-class IKK inhibitor and its potential use in cancer treatment is under evaluation.

We previously showed that S4600 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a variety of human cancer cell lines \[[@B10-ijms-18-02533]\]. To determine whether the compound affects human fibroblasts, we tested the cytotoxicity of S4600 on WI-38 cells and found that it did not induce cell death at concentrations up to 1 µM.

Prompt:  S4602 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4602 is a drug that targets a novel signaling pathway. First, it acts as a DYRK1A inhibitor, which is well known to promote the cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. This activity is different from the activity of a traditional cell cycle inhibitor. Second, S4602 can activate autophagy and apoptosis, which are very important for the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment of malignant diseases. Third, S4602 has potent anticancer activity in *in vivo* tumor xenograft models, with an effect comparable to that of the clinically used drug, cisplatin. The therapeutic efficacy of S4602 is promising for the treatment of malignant tumors. However, it is important to understand the mechanism of the anticancer activity of S4602 in order to fully exploit its potential as a novel anticancer agent.

There are few therapeutic options available for spinal cord injury. It is a devastating neurological condition that often results in paralysis and chronic disability. For spinal cord injury, there is no effective treatment, and patients are often left with permanent paralysis. Currently, there is no cure for spinal cord injury, and the best current treatment is to keep the injured area of the spinal cord from being damaged further by minimizing any further trauma.

The development of stem cells into cells that are specialized for the damaged area of the spinal cord may be a promising way to restore spinal cord function after injury. However, the methods of developing these stem cells can be time consuming, expensive, and there is no guarantee that they will work.

The ligand-receptor interaction activates the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and promotes cell proliferation and survival. KIT has a wide range of tyrosine kinase-related activities including signal transduction, adhesion, migration and differentiation. This receptor is involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and in oncogenesis. KIT is frequently overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, germ cell tumors and pancreatic tumors. KIT has also been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia, mastocytosis and angiosarcoma.

Prompt:  S4628 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4628 is a drug that targets CCR5 and prevents the HIV-1 entry into the cell. We found that CCR5 is highly expressed on the surface of CD4^+^ T cells and monocytes. In contrast, the CCR5 expression on the surface of CD4^+^ T cells and monocytes is not affected by the drug. In addition, the expression of CCR5 is not affected by the drug on CD4^+^ T cells and monocytes from HIV-1-infected individuals. Therefore, it is unlikely that CCR5 plays a role in the efficacy of MVC.

As CCR5 is an important co-receptor for HIV-1 entry, we further analyzed the expression of CCR5 on CD4^+^ T cells and monocytes from healthy individuals and HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that CCR5 expression on the surface of CD4^+^ T cells is increased

Prompt:  S4630 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4630 is a drug that targets the nuclear import of STAT3 and thereby causes nuclear accumulation of the protein and growth inhibition. In fact, S4630 inhibited the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells *in vitro* and *in vivo* ([@b19-ijo-46-06-1993],[@b20-ijo-46-06-1993]). However, we also found that S4630 was cytotoxic to normal human fibroblasts and induced caspase-3/7 activity. This is the first report of the *in vivo* efficacy of S4630 in a murine xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer.

In this study, we found that the proliferation of tumor cells was significantly inhibited by S4630. This is consistent with previous reports that S4630 inhibited the growth of various tumor cells *in vitro* and *in vivo* ([@b19-ijo-46-06-1993

Response: S4632 is a drug that targets mTOR. We used S6K1 and S6K2 inhibitors to demonstrate the relationship between the mTOR and EMT signaling pathways. Our results show that EMT-like cells treated with S6K1 and S6K2 inhibitors have decreased levels of mesenchymal markers, while the expression of epithelial markers is increased. These results are similar to the results of previous studies.^[@bib25],\ [@bib28]^ We further found that EMT-like cells treated with S6K1 and S6K2 inhibitors are sensitive to 5-FU treatment.

Response: S4635 is a drug that targets PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, with the potential to improve the survival of melanoma patients ([@B16]). In the current study, we firstly identified the expression of PD-1 in human melanoma cell lines, and found that PD-1 was highly expressed in WM115 and SK-MEL-28 cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway played an important role in regulating the function of CD8^+^ T cells in melanoma. This is consistent with the previous study that PD-1 expression is up-regulated in the CD8^+^ T cells in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients ([@B36]).

Prompt:  S4636 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4636 is a drug that targets the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, VEGFR2. It has been developed by OncoImmunin for the treatment of various cancers. We studied the effect of S4636 on the growth of prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and found that S4636 inhibited the growth of PCa cell lines. S4636 inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP and DU145 cells, with IC50 values of 1.1 and 0.7 µM, respectively. Cell cycle analysis showed that S4636 induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in both cell lines. S4636 also induced apoptosis in both cell lines. S4636 induced apoptosis by upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2. Furthermore, S4636 inhibited the growth of human PCa xenografts in nude mice. These results suggest that S4636 is a

Prompt:  S4637 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4637 is a drug that targets Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein and is currently being tested in Phase I/II clinical trials. Bcl-2 is known to regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria. However, the relationship between Bcl-2 and Smac/DIABLO is not fully understood. Here, we show that Bcl-2 can prevent Smac/DIABLO from binding to XIAP. As a result, Smac/DIABLO does not promote the degradation of XIAP, which leads to the stabilization of XIAP. Bcl-2-induced stabilization of XIAP results in the inhibition of Smac/DIABLO-mediated apoptosis. These findings suggest that Bcl-2 has the ability to interfere with the activation of caspases by Smac/DIABLO.

Response: S4638 is a drug that targets human telomerase. The drug inhibits the enzyme, which is required for cancer cell proliferation. In mice, it slows tumor growth and increases survival time by about two months. In a trial, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who had already failed chemotherapy lived an average of six months longer than those who received placebo.

The drug has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients who have failed at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.

The S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) is a major player in the cell cycle. The expression of SKP2 is increased in many types of cancer, including those of the pancreas.

Response: S4640 is a drug that targets a critical enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which controls the rate of fatty acid synthesis and the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the main precursor of fatty acids ([@bib17]). ACC is an attractive drug target because of its central role in regulating fatty acid synthesis. S4072 is a derivative of S4640 that has an additional carboxylic acid in the alkyl chain that leads to a substantially higher plasma exposure of S4072 than S4640 ([@bib11]). The in vitro activity of S4072 is comparable to that of S4640 ([@bib11]).

Prompt:  S4646 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4646 is a drug that targets the Kv1.5 channel, which is responsible for the repolarization of the heart after the action potential. In cardiac muscle, Kv1.5 is expressed on the surface of the plasma membrane in the sarcolemma, and contributes to the repolarization of the action potential, which allows for proper transmission of action potentials through the heart. When there is an abnormality in the ion channels responsible for the repolarization of the heart, the heart may not be able to contract or the action potential may not be properly transmitted.

Response: S4647 is a drug that targets the retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ) and retinoid X receptor beta (RXRβ) in the brain.

Response: S4649 is a drug that targets the mitochondrial Complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. Mitochondrial Complex I dysfunction is linked to mitochondrial energy metabolism impairment, which is a main cause of neurodegenerative diseases including PD. We have previously reported that NQO1 protects against mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death induced by rotenone, which is a mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor. However, the role of NQO1 in the rotenone-induced neurotoxicity has not been elucidated. Here, we show that rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death are significantly suppressed by NQO1 knockdown in SH-SY5Y cells. We also demonstrate that NQO1 knockdown attenuates rotenone-induced ER stress in the cells. Furthermore, we found that NQO1 knockdown protects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress by up-regulating autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells

Response: S4656 is a drug that targets a different pathway than NGF. We have found that this compound is highly selective for the NCAM-1 receptor. A Phase II clinical trial is currently underway to test the safety and efficacy of this compound in patients with MS.

5. Future Directions {#sec5}
====================

NGF is a neurotrophic factor that is important for the development and maintenance of neurons and plays a critical role in the maintenance of myelin. Because of its potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as MS, there has been considerable interest in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of NGF action. However, the lack of highly selective small molecule antagonists for NGF has made it difficult to address these mechanisms in a cell-specific manner. A recent development in this area has been the discovery of small molecule antagonists of NGF receptor tyrosine kinases \[[@B6], [@B7], [@B

Prompt:  S4658 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4658 is a drug that targets the checkpoint kinase CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1). This protein is an important player in cell cycle control. When DNA is damaged, it inhibits cell cycle progression, allowing time for the cell to repair the damage. CHK1 helps to initiate repair of the damage by inhibiting the activity of the CDC25A (cell division cycle 25A) protein. By inhibiting this protein, CHK1 keeps cells from entering mitosis when they are damaged. In a clinical trial, niraparib was found to be very effective in treating ovarian cancer. Niraparib blocks the CHK1 protein, allowing the cells to progress through the cell cycle and initiate repair of the damage. By inhibiting the CHK1 protein, cells are not able to repair the damage. This leads to cell death.

Prompt:  S4660 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4660 is a drug that targets histone deacetylase. The first published studies indicated that it increased lifespan in mice ([@bib13]), but it was not known whether this was because of an effect on the epigenome. The longevity effect is due to a major disruption of the epigenome, with an increase in gene expression of many proteins with functions in cellular repair and metabolism.

The study of [@bib14] on the effect of the drug in *C. elegans* suggested that there might be an effect on the epigenome, but the study did not directly examine this. The authors showed that the drug affected the acetylation of H3K56 in worms. This is a histone modification that is found on transcribed genes, and so a change in its acetylation status could have an effect on the transcription of many genes.

Response: S4664 is a drug that targets IKKβ. It is an orally available, selective, and potent inhibitor of the IKK complex that is being developed for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. Here, we have performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to define the structural determinants of IKKβ selectivity and to improve potency and selectivity of the lead compound S1. We found that the presence of an ethyl group at the para position of the benzimidazole ring is essential for high potency and selectivity of S1. Replacement of the ethyl group with a methyl group increased the potency but decreased the selectivity. However, the removal of the ethyl group and the addition of a methyl group at the meta position restored the potency and selectivity.

S4668 is a potent and specific inhibitor of the kidney NKA, which is used to increase the excretion of Na and K in the urine and to treat hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. S4668 is in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure.^[@ref38]^ In this study, the effect of S4668 on P-gp was investigated by examining the bidirectional transport of a P-gp substrate in LLC-PK1 cells.

Prompt:  S4669 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4669 is a drug that targets mitochondria and is being investigated in clinical trials for treatment of a variety of cancers. However, the efficacy of S4669 in cancer treatment has been questioned due to toxicity concerns. Our studies have shown that S4669 induces autophagy, which in turn leads to tumor cell death. We found that in the presence of S4669, mTOR is activated by downregulation of TSC2. We also found that the TSC2-mTOR complex binds to ULK1 and prevents ULK1 activation, and that the activity of the TSC2-mTOR complex is negatively regulated by ULK1. We also found that mTOR and ULK1 form a complex, and that the TSC2-mTOR complex binds to this ULK1-mTOR complex. Our studies indicate that S4669-induced autophagy involves inactivation of the TSC2-mTOR complex and the ULK1-m

Prompt:  S4673 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4673 is a drug that targets the HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway, which plays a vital role in angiogenesis. A recent study demonstrated that a high-fat diet leads to the upregulation of VEGF in the liver, which in turn promotes HCC progression ([@B21]). HIF-1α/VEGF signaling plays an important role in tumor progression and is a target for HCC treatment ([@B12]). Therefore, we focused on the effect of PGF on HIF-1α/VEGF signaling in HepG2 cells. As shown in [Figure 3A](#F3){ref-type="fig"}, the mRNA expression of VEGF was increased in HepG2 cells treated with a high-fat diet, and this effect was attenuated by PGF. Similarly, western blot analysis revealed that the protein levels of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were also upregulated in HepG2

Response: S4674 is a drug that targets the cardiac glycoside binding site of Na,K-ATPase and increases Na,K-ATPase activity, thus increasing ouabain-sensitive sodium extrusion in cardiomyocytes. To study the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of S-4674 in mice, a novel HPLC-UV assay was developed and validated. The assay was applied to a pharmacokinetic study in mice and a pharmacodynamic study in dogs. In the pharmacokinetic study, S-4674 was administered intravenously (i.v.) or orally to mice. The absolute bioavailability of S-4674 was about 40% following i.v. administration and approximately 100% following oral administration. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) after oral administration was 9.0 μg·h/mL. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, CL, Vd

Prompt:  S4675 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4675 is a drug that targets both the cholesterol and glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic pathways, which results in the suppression of tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. We performed an integrated analysis of the effects of BMS-470566 on cell growth and glycosaminoglycan and cholesterol biosynthesis in a panel of cancer cell lines and found that the drug had distinct anti-tumor activity in lung and breast cancer cell lines. BMS-470566 also exhibited synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel, as well as in a lung cancer mouse xenograft model. We conclude that BMS-470566 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of cancer, especially lung and breast cancer.

Prompt:  S4678 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4678 is a drug that targets the EGF receptor and inhibits tumor growth in several cancer cell lines \[[@CR63]\]. It is an oral drug that has shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells. A recent study in glioblastoma cells showed that S4678 reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and induced apoptosis via a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in p21 and Bax expression \[[@CR64]\]. This drug has shown therapeutic potential in pancreatic cancer cells \[[@CR65]\] and in glioblastoma cells \[[@CR66]\].

To summarize, the data show that both drug-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity depend on the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, although they are not necessarily related. The simultaneous inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR

Prompt:  S4679 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4679 is a drug that targets a specific, critical, step in the multistep process that regulates HIV-1 gene expression and replication. The drug was developed to specifically inhibit HIV-1 replication in cells that have been pre-treated with drugs that specifically inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The new drug, called IN S4679, is the first drug to inhibit HIV-1 replication by specifically inhibiting the function of a cellular co-factor required for viral replication. The drug inhibits HIV-1 replication in infected cells in vitro and blocks the progression of HIV-1 infection in cell culture. IN S4679 is also active against a number of HIV-1 isolates, including primary isolates from drug-naive individuals.

IN S4679 is a novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that specifically targets the Rev-Cys-Cys-His-Arg (CCH) motif that is required for interaction with the cellular co-factor, LED

Prompt:  S4680 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4680 is a drug that targets the chemokine receptor CCR5 and is approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It is also used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, S1P and S1PRs are also expressed on other cell types, including activated and mature DCs and NK cells, as well as on many cell types of the immune system. The use of S1P analogues in immune modulation is therefore likely to have a broad spectrum of effects.

The aim of this study was to characterize the immunomodulatory activity of S1P and its analogues in human DCs. We have investigated the effect of S1P and its analogues on DC activation, maturation and migration, and on the modulation of the expression of cell surface molecules involved in DC activation and antigen presentation. We have also studied the role of S1PRs in DC migration in

Prompt:  S4682 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4682 is a drug that targets a specific pathway to inhibit cell proliferation. However, its specificity has not been clearly defined. In this study, we have demonstrated that P-gp can be an important mediator of S-4682-induced cell death in P-gp-expressing cancer cells. The P-gp-specific inhibitor, tariquidar, and P-gp siRNA could reverse the P-gp-mediated S-4682-induced cell death in HCT-116 cells. We further found that P-gp expression is essential for the P-gp-mediated cell death and its inhibition can increase the anticancer efficacy of S-4682 in HCT-116 cells. Our data demonstrate that S-4682 is a novel P-gp substrate and that P-gp expression can regulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to S-4682. Therefore, P-gp is an important mediator of S-4682-induced cell death in P-gp

Prompt:  S4684 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4684 is a drug that targets the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and is being developed by AstraZeneca. Although initially it was believed that S4684 was able to selectively inhibit CDK2 over CDK1, this was later shown to be due to a lack of CDK1 specificity in the assay used to measure activity. In addition, S4684 has also been shown to inhibit CDK5, an enzyme that also plays a role in neuronal survival. In vivo studies showed that S4684 was effective in both murine models of Huntington's disease and an animal model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). These results suggest that S4684 has the potential to be a drug for the treatment of Huntington's disease, SBMA, and other diseases that are associated with the pathogenesis of CDK2.

Prompt:  S4685 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4685 is a drug that targets a unique cellular event (differentiation) that occurs in some, but not all, cancer cells, but not in normal cells. In addition, we showed that S4685 is more effective against TNBC and basal-like breast cancer cells than non-TNBC and non-basal-like cells, respectively. We believe that this novel approach will be useful in the treatment of TNBC and basal-like breast cancer.

TNBC is one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes and is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu amplification ([@B21]). Although triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been the subject of intense investigation, the mechanisms underlying its development and progression are poorly understood ([@B22]). TNBC is considered to be an independent poor prognostic subtype with high mortality rate ([@B23]). Recent studies showed that TNBC

FGF2 is a potent mitogen for many mesothelial cells and a potent stimulator of the growth of mesothelioma cells. Therefore, FGF2 may be a potential therapeutic target in mesothelioma. Indeed, small-molecule inhibitors of FGF2 signaling have been developed, and some of them have shown promising anti-mesothelioma activity in the pre-clinical models \[[@R37]--[@R39]\]. However, these inhibitors also affect other cell types that express FGF2, including endothelial cells, and are thus not selective for

In this study, we examined the activity of S4686 and S4689 in vitro and in vivo, and also investigated the pharmacokinetics of S4686 and its metabolite in mouse plasma and tissue. In vitro, S4686 and S4689 both inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in PANC-1 cells. S4686 inhibited the growth of PANC-1 xenografts and S4689 did not. S4686 was metabolized in the liver, and S4689 was not metabolized in the liver. The S4686 metabolite was eliminated from the blood circulation rapidly and was eliminated from the liver very rapidly.

Prompt:  S4693 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4693 is a drug that targets the 5-HT4 receptor. While these drugs are not perfect, they have significantly reduced the rate of mortality and improvement in neurocognitive function.

In addition to the 5-HT4 receptor, the gut has an additional serotonin receptor, the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a receptor that has been linked to some forms of IBS. IBS is a condition where the gastrointestinal tract is unable to control the movement of fluids. IBS is a symptom of many conditions, but in the most severe cases, IBS is associated with significant discomfort.

5-HT3 receptors are involved in the contraction of smooth muscles in the intestines, which causes pain. By reducing the number of 5-HT3 receptors, it is thought that the bowel can relax and move more fluid. This reduces the pain of the IBS.

A human clinical trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists on I

Prompt:  S4696 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4696 is a drug that targets the constitutive active PI3Kγ, the only γ isoform in humans, which is a key player in cancer progression. Since PI3Kγ is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancer, the use of PI3Kγ inhibitors for cancer treatment has been a topic of intense research. In the past few years, several groups have investigated the potential of S4696 for the treatment of cancer. In addition to this, many PI3Kγ inhibitors have been reported in the literature. However, their selectivity and the mechanism of action of these inhibitors in different cancer models are not well established. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing data regarding the use of S4696 and other PI3Kγ inhibitors in the treatment of cancer.

Prompt:  S4709 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4709 is a drug that targets a subpopulation of CD8+ T cells that have the ability to produce IFN-gamma. We show that the primary function of CD8+ T cells in the anti-tumor response is not the production of IFN-gamma but the production of TNF-alpha. In contrast to the response in IFN-gamma deficient mice, the response in TNF-alpha deficient mice was less effective and more tumor specific. Thus, TNF-alpha production in CD8+ T cells plays a major role in the anti-tumor response and in its efficacy. These results also provide the first demonstration that TNF-alpha production by CD8+ T cells is controlled by the specific TCR/MHC interaction.

As a result, the ERK pathway is blocked, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and proliferation ([@b10-ol-0-0-9588],[@b11-ol-0-0-9588]). As the treatment of cancer is very important, we performed a literature search on the PubMed and Ovid databases to compare the current clinical data of the BRAF-MEK-ERK inhibitor in melanoma. We used the keywords 'BRAF', 'MEK' and 'ERK' to search for studies published between January 2010 and December 2018. Studies were limited to clinical trials, randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria ([@b10-ol-0-0-9588],[@b11-ol-0-0

Prompt:  S4717 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4717 is a drug that targets the P-glycoprotein transporter in the blood-brain barrier, which is responsible for the removal of xenobiotics from the brain and the accumulation of cytotoxic drugs in the brain.^[@R44]^ Because P-glycoprotein expression is downregulated in the GBM cells in which CSCs reside,^[@R44]^ treatment with S4717 may be able to increase the accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in GBM CSCs.

Other potential targets include the GSK-3β and AKT signaling pathways.^[@R16],[@R17],[@R45]^ The activation of the GSK-3β pathway in GBM is a major contributor to the progression of the disease,^[@R16]^ and it has been shown that GSK-3β regulates self-renewal in CSCs.^[@R17]

Prompt:  S4718 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4718 is a drug that targets BCL2L1 (Bcl-2) by binding to the BH3 domain of BCL2L1 and mimicking BH3-only proteins, thus preventing the formation of a heterodimer with BCL2 and inhibiting apoptosis^[@R1]^. As the gene encoding BCL2L1 is highly amplified in some solid tumours, including ovarian and prostate cancers, S4718 has been developed as a targeted cancer therapy^[@R1]^. Despite the encouraging initial clinical activity of S4718, single-agent S4718 failed to induce tumour regressions in phase II trials in ovarian cancer^[@R2]^ and advanced solid tumours^[@R3]^. This led to the development of S1536, a more potent and selective BCL2L1 inhibitor, which showed clinical activity in solid tumours including ovarian cancer^[@R

Prompt:  S4721 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4721 is a drug that targets the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, including CRC ([@b35-ol-0-0-9853]). It is the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced CRC and is also a key agent in the development of targeted therapies for this disease ([@b35-ol-0-0-9853]). However, the use of S4721 in combination with chemotherapy has been limited by its toxicity. For example, the combination of S4721 with irinotecan was associated with a 3.8-fold increase in the risk of severe neutropenia and a 4.6-fold increase in the risk of febrile neutropenia, which are adverse events that affect the treatment of patients with cancer ([@b36-ol-0-0-9853]).

Prompt:  S4722 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4722 is a drug that targets the S4720A mutation in POLD1.^[@bib29]^ Treatment with S4722 was initiated immediately after 1 h of CPT exposure. The number of cell death events was reduced from 27% to 14% ([Figure 2a](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). As expected, cells treated with the S4722 compound showed no accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle ([Figure 2b](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). Thus, the S4722 compound can protect the cells from CPT-induced cell death by interfering with the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase.

A different effect of the two compounds was observed when cells were exposed to an alternative cell death inducer. As shown in [Figure 2c](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}, treatment with 10 *μ*

Prompt:  S4723 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4723 is a drug that targets LMP1 and LMP2A, and has been shown to have an IC~50~ of \~1 µM for both LMP1 and LMP2A ([@B68]). In contrast to the NS-LCL, this drug has no effect on cell growth or apoptosis in the EBV-transformed cell lines in which it was tested ([@B68]). Thus, the growth of EBV-positive cell lines can be rescued by treatment with a drug that targets a single EBV gene, suggesting that one of the roles of EBNA1 is to repress a cell growth inhibitory pathway.

Response: S4726 is a drug that targets a number of different molecular pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. We have investigated the effects of C4726 on the growth of a panel of human and mouse cell lines and have demonstrated that it inhibits the growth of cell lines derived from several human tumours including colorectal, lung and breast cancers. A panel of human colon cancer cell lines derived from the same patient were also used to demonstrate that C4726 was effective in treating patients with metastatic disease. Our data demonstrate that C4726 is a potent anti-tumour agent with activity against both solid tumours and hematological malignancies.

Prompt:  S4734 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4734 is a drug that targets the KIT tyrosine kinase, which is involved in the development and progression of mastocytosis and other cancers. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration approved crenolanib for the treatment of mastocytosis and other hematologic malignancies. However, the utility of this drug in the treatment of mastocytosis is limited by its short half-life and adverse side effects.1 Here, we report that a recently developed second-generation crenolanib analog, PPI-1007, with a half-life of 19.3 hours, is a more potent and selective KIT inhibitor that is effective in mast cell-mediated disease models and can be used to ameliorate the adverse side effects of crenolanib.

Prompt:  S4735 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4735 is a drug that targets the GPR4 receptor, a protein found on the surface of the membranes of cells, including cells in the brain. GPR4 is involved in the uptake of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that acts on cells in the brain. When S4735 is taken into cells that contain GPR4, the receptor is blocked. This blocks the glutamate uptake, so the neurotransmitter can’t be taken into the cell. This can cause problems in the brain, as it causes the release of glutamate into the synapse, causing excitotoxicity. This is similar to how an over-dose of Valium can cause the release of too much neurotransmitter into the synapse, causing excitotoxicity. The S4735 causes a similar effect.

It is thought that this drug can be used as a treatment for schizophrenia, because it is thought that schizophrenia is caused by excessive levels of glutamate. The idea is that by blocking the uptake of

Prompt:  S4736 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4736 is a drug that targets the topoisomerase-1 enzyme. Topoisomerase-1 plays an important role in DNA replication, transcription and chromosome condensation. It has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, and other cancers. The development of CPT-11 was an early success for Topotecan. It was the first topoisomerase-1 inhibitor approved for the treatment of cancer. Its action is distinct from that of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Its mode of action involves inhibition of the breakage and rejoining of the DNA strands, thus inhibiting the action of topoisomerase-1. It acts by trapping the enzyme on the DNA. However, the drug has poor solubility and it undergoes rapid hydrolysis. It is currently approved for the treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and small cell lung cancer.

Prompt:  S4737 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4737 is a drug that targets multiple cell signaling pathways and induces tumor cell apoptosis.^[@bib26]^ Thus, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio may also have contributed to the apoptotic response.

In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that cell death and Bax/Bcl-2 expression are involved in the apoptotic effect of MLN4924 in human lung cancer cells. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in MLN4924-induced apoptosis.

Prompt:  S4741 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4741 is a drug that targets the ribosome and thus can be used to study the effects of the inhibition of protein synthesis on cell physiology. In a microarray experiment, the induction of transcription of several genes was found to be attenuated by S4741 ([@B7]). To further explore the mode of action of S4741, we performed a time course microarray experiment and compared the transcriptional profile of the treated cells with the profile of untreated cells. In the presence of S4741, there was a delay in the induction of transcription of many genes ([Figure 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}A). The delay was most pronounced at 1 h and for a majority of genes was more pronounced at 4 h than at 8 h. To test whether the observed delay in the transcriptional induction is caused by the inhibition of protein synthesis, we repeated the experiment in the presence of cycloheximide. The profile of

Prompt:  S4750 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4750 is a drug that targets P2X7 receptors and is a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. To test the in vivo effects of S4750, we used a mouse model of LPS-induced sepsis. S4750 was administered to mice intraperitoneally at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. We found that the high dose of S4750 (10 mg/kg) completely abolished LPS-induced body weight loss, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia, but did not significantly affect the level of blood glucose, which suggests that S4750 does not induce hyperglycemia in vivo. S4750 significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the plasma and in the peritoneal lavage fluid.

Prompt:  S4751 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4751 is a drug that targets and kills tumor cells by activating caspase-3. To date, many types of tumor cells have been identified as being sensitive to S4751 treatment, such as leukemia, lymphoma, breast, prostate, and colon cancer cells. It is also effective in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), melanoma, and multiple myeloma. The clinical efficacy of S4751 was demonstrated in several phase I and phase II clinical trials.

Prompt:  S4752 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4752 is a drug that targets B-cell lymphoma. We have previously shown that treatment of B-cell lymphoma cell lines with S4752 resulted in increased autophagy, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of S4752 on autophagy in mouse bone marrow cells (BMC) and whether S4752 induces apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60). We found that S4752 inhibited the proliferation of mouse BMC and human HL-60 cells. S4752 induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in mouse BMC and HL-60 cells. S4752-induced autophagy was not observed in mouse BMC and HL-60 cells. Our results indicate that S4752-induced autophagy in mouse BMC and HL-60 cells is not a cytoprotective mechanism.

Prompt:  S4754 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4754 is a drug that targets a receptor on the surface of neurons called AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The receptor binds to the drug and prevents it from binding to glutamate, which it normally does. This prevents glutamate from binding to AMPA receptors, and thus prevents the activation of these receptors. The resulting lack of glutamate at these receptors leads to the same effect as blocking them, and prevents the formation of the neural networks responsible for learning. This can prevent the development of seizures, or even prevent the onset of seizures.

Prompt:  S4759 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4759 is a drug that targets the mTORC1 pathway. This inhibitor blocks mTORC1 activation, which results in a decrease in the levels of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. A small decrease in the level of phosphorylated AKT is observed. By measuring cell growth and cell size, the authors show that this compound decreases cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC~50~ of \~5 μM. The IC~50~ of the compound for proliferation is 10 μM. However, the effect on cell size was not measured. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure cell size in the presence of this compound. This study shows that S4759 can decrease cell size in two different cell types, which is consistent with previous studies. These studies showed that treatment with S4759 can reduce the size of pancreatic β-cells in culture ([@B40]), as well as induce a decrease in size

Prompt:  S4768 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4768 is a drug that targets a common receptor (s) for various neurotransmitters. It has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. It is an effective antidepressant in animals and humans. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. In addition, S4768 has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of various medical conditions such as pain, neuropathic pain, and various other medical conditions.

It is reported that S4768 acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, with a Ki value of 14 nM. It has been shown to be a potent and selective antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, with a higher affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor subtype than for the 5-HT2C receptor subtype. S47

Prompt:  S4770 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4770 is a drug that targets the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, and the FDA approved it in 2010 for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). SAG is a naturally occurring compound that activates the Hh signaling pathway by binding to the smoothened (SMO) receptor, an intracellular transducer of the Hh pathway. SAG induces the degradation of the cytoplasmic protein GLI, a transcriptional activator of Hh target genes. GLI1 is overexpressed in most basal cell carcinomas, and it has been suggested that GLI1 inhibition could represent a therapeutic strategy in these cancers. However, it has been shown that SAG can inhibit the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that SAG induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, including those with wild-type (wt) p53, as well

Prompt:  S4776 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4776 is a drug that targets the intracellular protein, E1A-binding protein p300 (CBP), to inhibit tumor cell growth, migration and angiogenesis. However, clinical application of S4776 is limited by its toxicity. In this study, we found that S4776 treatment induced phosphorylation of E1A-binding protein p300 (p-CBP) in tumor cells. The induction of p-CBP by S4776 was mediated by phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. We also showed that the induction of p-CBP by S4776 was essential for the induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment of cancer cells with S4776 in vivo induced p-CBP and inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our results indicated that S4776 may be a promising drug for cancer treatment.

Prompt:  S4779 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4779 is a drug that targets the human Notch1 receptor, which is a type of cell-cell signaling protein that can be found on most cells in the body. When the protein binds to its ligand, Notch1, it can activate or suppress genes.

Because Notch1 can activate genes, S4779 is able to stop the cells from growing and divide, but because it can suppress genes, S4779 is able to slow or stop the cells from dividing.

In the first-in-human study, the researchers found that S4779 showed a good safety profile in mice. The drug was well tolerated and did not cause any serious side effects. The team also found that the drug could block the growth of human tumors that are caused by Notch1.

The researchers say that more studies are needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans, but they believe that it could be a promising treatment for cancers that are caused

Response: S4794 is a drug that targets the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and can be used to block the activation of neurons and muscle cells. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is a hetero-pentameric G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by acetylcholine (ACh). It is composed of five subunits that have been classified into five subtypes based on the presence of unique allosteric sites (M1-M5). The M1-M4 receptors mediate the classical actions of ACh while the M5 receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of the excitability of neurons.

Response: S4795 is a drug that targets a molecule called proteasome. Proteasome is a protein complex in the cell that is responsible for the destruction of damaged proteins. When cells are stressed, proteasome activity increases. Drugs like S4795, in theory, are designed to interfere with this process. In theory, they would slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, as well as autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis.

The original S4795 was a molecule called M50. It was originally discovered by Dr. Bill Brunken at the University of Kansas in 2005. Brunken found that the drug could improve cognitive function in mice with Alzheimer's disease. However, he later found that the drug also increased inflammation and caused brain swelling. M50 was later shelved as a potential Alzheimer's treatment.

This year, Dr. Bill Brunken and his colleagues at the University of Kansas published a

Prompt:  S4800 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4800 is a drug that targets histone deacetylases (HDACs). This study investigated the potential of S4800 as a therapy for hematologic malignancies. We analyzed the effects of S4800 on leukemic cells in vitro and in a mouse model of leukemia. In vitro, S4800 induced a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in various types of leukemia cells and synergized with chemotherapy drugs. S4800 induced apoptosis in leukemia cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. The expression of antiapoptotic proteins was reduced, and proapoptotic proteins were increased by S4800 treatment. In a mouse model of leukemia, S4800 significantly prolonged the survival of mice with leukemia. S4800 showed a high therapeutic index in vivo and did not cause major side effects. Our results demonstrate that S4800 is a promising new therapy for hematologic malignancies.

Prompt:  S4810 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4810 is a drug that targets the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in the brain. When administered in the cortex, it increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and causes a mild antidepressant effect in rodents, which lasts for up to 6 weeks (refs [@ref1], [@ref2]). In human studies, S4810 improved depressive symptoms in a Phase 2b trial[@ref3] and was well tolerated in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.[@ref4]

The mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of S4810 are not well understood. BDNF is known to have an important role in the pathophysiology of depression.[@ref5] The A2AR is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum.[@ref6] Activation of the A2AR by endogenous adenosine suppresses the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (

Prompt:  S4812 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4812 is a drug that targets the hematopoietic stem cell compartment in the bone marrow. The effect of S4812 on leukocyte cell-surface antigens was studied in a panel of human leukocyte subsets and in mice. S4812 increased the expression of CD11b and CD14 on human monocytes. S4812 induced a rapid decrease in the expression of CD4 and CD8 on human T lymphocytes, and CD19 on human B lymphocytes. S4812 treatment of mice induced an increase in the percentage of CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells in the bone marrow and in the spleen. S4812 treatment also increased the expression of CD11b on macrophages and granulocytes. Thus, S4812 is a drug that affects the expression of surface markers on leukocyte populations.

Prompt:  S4816 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4816 is a drug that targets a protein called isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). It has shown promising results in a number of cancers, including brain cancer. A major drawback is that it has not been tested in the blood, the best way to detect the presence of brain tumors.

The S4816 trial in the United States is an open-label study. This means that the doctors, patients, and the research team do not know who is getting the drug and who is not. This is the standard way of conducting clinical trials.

At the time of this article’s publication, the trial has been going on for two years and is still ongoing. There are currently 13 patients enrolled, all of them children. One of the patients has completed the study and was found to be a responder.

Prompt:  S4826 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4826 is a drug that targets a protein called Dvl1.

The protein is involved in Wnt signalling, which is an important pathway in the body.

It's a crucial part of many processes in the body including cell growth and repair.

It's also involved in the development of the nervous system, the heart, and other parts of the body.

And Wnt signalling has been linked to the development of some cancers.

The Dvl1 protein is thought to be important in some cancers, including cancers of the breast, ovaries, and prostate.

It's also thought to be involved in some other diseases, including a condition called 'congenital heart disease' which affects babies before they are born.

So, when scientists found that S4826 could target Dvl1, they were excited.

They thought it might have some potential as a new cancer treatment.

Response: S4830 is a drug that targets HSP90, a molecular chaperone that is involved in protein folding and cellular stress response. The potential of using HSP90 as a target for cancer treatment has been extensively explored. HSP90 inhibitors are now being evaluated in clinical trials.^[@bib1]^ The potential of HSP90 inhibitors as anticancer agents is based on the fact that many cancer cells express elevated levels of HSP90. However, some HSP90 inhibitors also inhibit the function of normal HSP90, and this may be one of the major obstacles to overcome before HSP90 inhibitors are considered as anticancer agents. The HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells.^[@bib2]^ In contrast, nonmalignant cells are less sensitive to 17-AAG.^[

Prompt:  S4831 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4831 is a drug that targets and kills the virus in patients. It was designed by a Japanese pharmaceutical company and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April of this year. The medicine is now the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. It is administered intravenously and has no known side effects. It is currently being tested on more than 1,200 patients in the United States, including in a double-blind clinical trial with 1,000 patients in the U.S. and 1,000 in Europe.

The key advantage of S4831 is that it is not a vaccine, and so it can be given to people who have recovered from the virus. In addition, unlike most other medicines for COVID-19, it has not been tested in animals.

It is also not yet known if S4831 is effective against all strains of the virus. It is most effective against the virus that causes COVID-19

Response: S4836 is a drug that targets the tumor suppressor PTEN by inhibiting its phosphatase activity \[[@B85-cancers-12-01034]\].

Despite the important role of miRNAs in cancer, the identification of miRNAs with oncogenic properties is not sufficient to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development. It is known that miRNAs have complex and often opposing functions depending on the cellular context. For instance, the same miRNA may be tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the tumor type \[[@B86-cancers-12-01034]\]. In this context, a more detailed understanding of the functions of each miRNA in cancer cells may provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development.

Response: S4844 is a drug that targets multiple kinases and signaling pathways. In addition, this drug inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, which is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that leads to cholesterol production. Cholesterol is essential for many cellular processes, including the formation of the plasma membrane and the maintenance of the function of lipid rafts. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins, which are used to treat hypercholesterolemia, have multiple mechanisms of action that have been linked to their potential to prevent and treat multiple sclerosis. In this article, we discuss the role of cholesterol and lipid rafts in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and the mechanisms by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be beneficial for treating multiple sclerosis.

Response: S4848 is a drug that targets angiogenesis, and its effect on ovarian cancer was assessed in a phase II clinical trial \[[@CR43]\]. The results showed that this drug was well tolerated, and there was no statistical difference in PFS and OS between the treatment group and the placebo group \[[@CR43]\]. The trial has been discontinued. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of S4848 versus placebo in patients with advanced EOC is ongoing.

There are many agents that have been reported to have anti-tumor activity in EOC, such as anti-angiogenesis, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and so on. Although these drugs have been tested in clinical trials, their clinical effects remain to be validated. For example, the efficacy of anti-angiogenesis drugs is limited in advanced EOC.

Prompt:  S4849 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4849 is a drug that targets myeloid cells and has been approved for the treatment of inflammatory myeloid disorders.

Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in myeloid cells leads to a marked expansion of HSPC. This effect is transient and reversible upon treatment withdrawal.

We propose that MEK/ERK inhibitors may be used in combination with standard of care drugs in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

Abstract

Inhibitors of MEK1/2 (U0126) are effective in a wide variety of malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, they do not affect AML cells in vitro, and their use in vivo has been limited by toxicity and drug resistance. In contrast, a new MEK1/2 inhibitor, S4849, was developed that is more selective and less toxic. We used S4849 in a murine AML model and found

Prompt:  S4850 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4850 is a drug that targets the v-Ki-ras oncogene. It is a selective, orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits mutant ras farnesylation, an essential step in ras activation. It was designed based on structure-based drug design and is structurally distinct from other farnesyl transferase inhibitors in the clinic, such as FTI-277. In vitro, S4850 potently inhibits mutant ras farnesylation and the growth of human cancer cells with oncogenic ras. In vivo, S4850 is effective at inhibiting the growth of human cancer xenografts and the growth of a panel of human cancer cell lines that harbor oncogenic K-ras.

Prompt:  S4851 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4851 is a drug that targets sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme, which is a NAD^+^-dependent deacetylase with numerous functions in the cell, including regulation of energy homeostasis and longevity. SIRT1 is one of seven sirtuins (SIRT1--7), and it is the best-characterized sirtuin ([@b2-bt-27-577]). SIRT1 is mainly localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation, genomic stability, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, and energy metabolism ([@b6-bt-27-577]). The functions of SIRT1 are closely associated with its intracellular localization and protein--protein interactions ([@b6-bt-27-577]).

SIRT1 has been suggested to be a therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer,

Prompt:  S4852 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4852 is a drug that targets the telomerase enzyme.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that consists of an RNA component (TERC) and a protein component (TERT). Telomerase is only expressed in cells that have an unlimited capacity to divide, and is not present in somatic cells (cells that make up the bulk of the body’s cells). This makes it a potential cancer therapy.

VX-3

Telomerase was the first drug developed to target telomerase. Telomerase was identified as a potential cancer therapy because telomeres become progressively shorter as cells divide. This limits the number of times a cell can divide. Cancer cells have a high rate of cell division, and they therefore have short telomeres. When telomerase is inhibited, telomeres become progressively longer, and cells are able to divide more times.

VX-3 was a telomerase inhibitor that

Response: S4856 is a drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway. It was developed as an experimental cancer drug and is currently undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials for patients with cancer of the brain and the pancreas.^[@bib50]^ However, the drug is also known to induce the tumor suppressor PTCH1.^[@bib51]^ Given the expression of Ptch1 in RGCs, we tested the effects of SAG on the survival of S4856-treated RGCs.

Prompt:  S4860 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4860 is a drug that targets a specific subset of microglia, and that might reduce the neuroinflammation and consequent cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies will be necessary to test the role of CD11b+ cells in other models of brain injury and neurodegeneration.

S4860 does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and is not taken up by peripheral macrophages. However, S4860 is taken up by peripheral leukocytes. It is likely that this leads to a reduction in peripheral macrophages. Future studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis.

In summary, we have identified a new, potent and selective compound that targets the IKK complex. S4860 has anti-inflammatory properties in an in vivo model of brain injury. The ability of S4860 to target the IKK complex provides a novel and selective approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Prompt:  S4865 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4865 is a drug that targets the ribosome. This is a well-established drug and it has been extensively studied. Its exact mechanism of action is still under investigation, but it has been shown to work by increasing the expression of heat shock proteins, which are involved in the repair of damaged proteins. It is often used in combination with a proteasome inhibitor, such as bortezomib, to help fight cancer.

Unfortunately, there is very little research done on S4865. We are working on understanding the mechanism of action of S4865 and other similar drugs to try and find a way to exploit them in order to fight cancer.

Cancer is a disease where a cell becomes abnormal and starts to grow out of control. When a cell grows out of control, it can start to cause damage to the body. This can cause things like pain, cancerous growths, and infections.

Prompt:  S4866 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4866 is a drug that targets the Src family kinase Lyn. When administered intravenously, it blocks Lyn from phosphorylating its target proteins. Therefore, S4866 blocks signaling pathways that Lyn is involved in, such as Ras-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells.

In animal models, it has been shown that S4866 inhibits the growth of cancer cells and causes regression of tumor xenografts.

The first human trial was started in 2005. Phase I trials showed that S4866 was well tolerated at the dose used in the trial. A phase II trial of S4866 in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer was started in 2006. In the trial, S4866 was well tolerated, and the drug was effective in two patients with colon cancer and one patient with lung cancer.

Response: S4875 is a drug that targets p53 and is approved for the treatment of metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer \[[@R1]\]. It binds to the DNA-binding domain of p53 and inhibits the transcription of p53-responsive genes. In addition, S4875 binds to MDM2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates p53 ubiquitination and degradation, and prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 \[[@R2]\]. Because p53 levels in prostate cancer cells are often very low \[[@R3]\], it is thought that the loss of p53 function is a critical step in the development of hormone refractory prostate cancer.

Prompt:  S4886 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4886 is a drug that targets the polyamine transport system in cancer cells. It inhibits the uptake of putrescine and spermidine and thereby inhibits the proliferation of cells, both cancer cells and non-cancer cells. The half-life of the drug is only a few minutes, and the drug is rapidly cleared from the body. The drug has the potential to be used as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer drugs. It is in phase II clinical trials.

Disease overview 
S4886 is an inhibitor of the transport of polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) in cancer cells. Polyamines are important in regulating cell proliferation, cell division and differentiation. S4886 blocks the transport of polyamines from the cytosol to the lysosome. In the lysosome, polyamines are degraded to their respective amino acids.

Prompt:  S4889 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4889 is a drug that targets TLR9, a receptor on the surface of B cells, and is in phase I/II clinical trials for treating CLL. In contrast, CD40L is a natural ligand of CD40 on the surface of T cells and promotes their proliferation and survival. Because TLR9 is highly expressed on B cells and CD40 is highly expressed on T cells, S4889 has the potential to be more effective in treating CLL than a drug targeting CD40 alone. As with other drugs currently being developed for CLL, S4889 is designed to target a single component of the malignant clone.

In summary, we have described a novel drug, S4889, that is designed to target a unique and specific component of the malignant clone in CLL. S4889 is in phase I/II clinical trials and will provide important information about the safety and efficacy of a single-agent therapy for CLL. The results of

Prompt:  S4893 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4893 is a drug that targets phosphorylated Akt and has been used to treat cancer. Here, we showed that S4893 was able to inhibit Akt phosphorylation and activation in the presence of IFN-γ in T-ALL cells, and was also able to decrease the expression of the Akt downstream target phosphorylated and activated mTOR (p-mTOR).

In addition, we showed that S4893 treatment could induce the apoptosis of T-ALL cells. These results are in agreement with the previous report that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and activation could induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells [@pone.0065093-Li1]. However, the effect of S4893 on T-ALL cells was different from the results of the study by Chang et al. [@pone.0065093-Chang1], which indicated that the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in human chronic myel

Prompt:  S4896 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4896 is a drug that targets the kinesin-5 KIF5A, an important regulator of centrosome duplication. We previously showed that it can selectively kill proliferating cells, including both cancer and normal stem cells, and can synergize with radiation and chemotherapy in mice ([@R1]). The drug is currently in phase 1 clinical trials for patients with advanced solid tumors ([@R2]).

The protein-targeted approach to anticancer therapy relies on the fact that a large proportion of cancer cells have defects in one or more genes involved in the regulation of cell division ([@R3]). Thus, in contrast to the limited number of tumor cell mutations that cause cancer, the human genome is densely packed with genes involved in cell division, with an average of \~400 cell cycle genes in each haploid genome ([@R4]). This means that cancer cells have a much higher probability of having a mutation in a protein that regulates cell division than normal cells. Indeed

Prompt:  S4899 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4899 is a drug that targets the ryanodine receptor. Its main action is to cause calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing calcium sparks, and subsequently, calcium-induced calcium release. As a result, calcium channels open, allowing calcium to flow into the cell, which ultimately leads to muscle contraction and relaxation.

We first tried to replicate the findings of the paper that showed that S4899 has antidepressant-like effects. We obtained human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing human ryanodine receptors and used the patch-clamp technique to measure calcium currents in these cells. S4899 had no effect on the amplitude of calcium currents (**[Figure 1A](#F1){ref-type="fig"}**). In addition, we examined whether S4899 affects calcium currents in a HEK 293 cell line that stably expresses mouse ryanodine receptors. S4899 did not affect calcium currents

Prompt:  S49076 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S49076 is a drug that targets a protein kinase, and thus may have a broader range of side effects. Furthermore, the effects of HSP90 inhibitor on HSP90-dependent pathways in the cells have not been determined, and the expression of HSP90-dependent proteins has not been determined. Thus, the use of S49076 in humans is not recommended.

Prompt:  S4931 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4931 is a drug that targets SIRT1 (and is a more specific inhibitor of SIRT1 than EX-527). Cells were treated with 10 μM of each drug and the viability of cells was analyzed after 72 h. As expected, both sirtinol and S4931 significantly inhibited the viability of *MYC*-expressing cells, but not *MYC*-silenced cells ([Figure 4D](#F4){ref-type="fig"}).

The effect of MYC overexpression on cellular senescence was further investigated by analyzing the expression of two senescence markers, namely *CDKN1A* (encoding p21) and *CDKN2A* (encoding p16). The *CDKN1A* and *CDKN2A* genes are known to be transcriptionally activated by MYC, and their expression levels are often used to measure the extent of senescence in cells ([

Prompt:  S4932 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4932 is a drug that targets topoisomerase II, an enzyme that plays a key role in maintaining DNA integrity during cell division. The drug intercalates with DNA, prevents the DNA decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, and causes double-strand DNA breaks that lead to cell death ([@bib3]). S-Trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) is a drug that prevents the function of topoisomerase II by competing with the natural substrate ([@bib13]). We have developed a set of dyes that can be used to label DNA and chromatin, and that exhibit changes in fluorescence intensity that are proportional to the concentration of STLC ([@bib7]). These dyes, which are called Topo-SNAP, can be used to study the effect of STLC on DNA and chromatin organization in cells.

Prompt:  S4933 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4933 is a drug that targets the expression of the gene, c-MYC, which is important for cancer cell growth. The *in vivo* anti-cancer efficacy of S4913 was investigated in a xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer. S4913 reduced tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, with no signs of toxicity at the dose of 40 mg/kg. Furthermore, the S4913-induced downregulation of c-MYC protein levels correlated with the downregulation of its downstream target genes. Therefore, S4913 could be an attractive candidate for further preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Response: S4949 is a drug that targets PSD-95. The drug increases the expression of PSD-95, and it also increases the number of synapses. If a drug can be developed that would increase the number of synapses, it would have a very important impact on the treatment of diseases like autism.

Prompt:  S4952 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4952 is a drug that targets the molecular chaperone HSP90. HSP90 is an essential protein that plays an important role in stabilizing and folding client proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival. It is over-expressed in many cancers and has been implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that S4952 is a potent inhibitor of HSP90, leading to degradation of client proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival. This includes important proteins involved in the development of cancer, such as Akt, c-Myc, and Bcl-2. The phase I and II clinical trials of S4952 demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity in patients with advanced cancer. In this article, we discuss the preclinical rationale and clinical development of S4952, including the recent phase III trial results of this drug in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

Prompt:  S4957 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4957 is a drug that targets Nrf2-Keap1 complex, a master regulator of antioxidant response in the cells. It was approved by the FDA in 2011 for treatment of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of S4957 on primary mouse hepatocytes in culture. S4957 induced an early increase in the levels of the anti-oxidant protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the cells. This was followed by an increase in the levels of the antioxidant enzyme catalase and a decrease in the levels of the pro-oxidant protein xanthine oxidase. The S4957-induced increase in HO-1 levels was Nrf2-dependent. S4957 increased the nuclear levels of Nrf2 and its binding to the ARE site of the HO-1 promoter. The antioxidant response

Response: S4964 is a drug that targets the CXCR2 receptor on the surface of neutrophils. It is used in a variety of clinical settings. S4964 is thought to prevent the migration of neutrophils from the blood stream into infected tissue. The effect of this drug has been evaluated in many studies involving sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI), and ARDS. These studies are summarized in this review. S4964 was initially tested in a sepsis model in the rat. The effect of S4964 was compared to that of a control agent, a CXCR2-neutralizing antibody. S4964 did not show a statistically significant improvement in survival, but showed a statistically significant reduction in the inflammatory response in the lung. The CXCR2-neutralizing antibody was not tested in a sepsis model. A phase II clinical trial of S4964 was carried out in patients with sepsis. This trial showed no significant effect

Prompt:  S4972 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4972 is a drug that targets the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The mechanism of action of the compound is based on its ability to bind and stabilize the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, preventing Cdc2 activation. The compound has shown activity in vitro and in vivo in many tumor types and is currently in phase I clinical trials in humans. In this study, we show that the effects of AZS4972 are mediated by an early apoptotic mechanism involving Cdc25A, a phosphatase that is required for Cdc2 activation. We show that AZS4972 binds and stabilizes the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, prevents Cdc2 activation, and causes Cdc25A accumulation and degradation. Importantly, this is the first report showing that a small molecule can cause Cdc25A accumulation and degradation.

Prompt:  S4973 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4973 is a drug that targets the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). It was initially developed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Mechanism of action

S4973 inhibits the cGMP-dependent kinase and therefore elevates cAMP levels, which results in a net increase in intracellular calcium concentration. This increases the contractility of the heart.

Pharmacokinetics

S4973 has been studied in several animal models, including dogs, monkeys, and rats.

Studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers and in patients with heart failure.

Pharmacodynamics

Elevated cAMP levels in the heart are associated with increased myocardial contractility. This is due to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).

Studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers and in patients with heart failure.

We observed that this drug induced an increase in the frequency of necrotic cells in the epimastigote form. In this work, we studied the effect of this drug in trypomastigotes and epimastigotes, showing that at low concentrations, it induced cell death by apoptosis, whereas at higher concentrations, it induced necrosis. A similar effect was observed in the trypomastigote form, where the cells underwent necrosis at high concentrations. This is the first report showing that this drug induces necrosis in trypomastigotes. In addition, we observed that this drug induced necrosis in other parasites, such as *T. cruzi*, *Leishmania major*, and *L. amazonensis*.

Prompt:  S4980 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4980 is a drug that targets DNA damage response (DDR) and was originally developed to treat breast cancer^[@R1]^. Its effects in melanoma have been less studied. We show that, as in breast cancer, this drug causes a large increase in DNA damage in melanoma cells. However, in contrast to breast cancer, where the effect is mediated through ATR and CHK1, in melanoma it is mediated through ATM. In breast cancer, the response to the drug was abrogated by RNAi knockdown of ATM. However, in melanoma, ATM inhibition only partially abrogated the response. These results suggest that DDR in melanoma is more complex than in breast cancer, perhaps due to differences in the mechanisms that control ATM activation. We further show that this drug causes a dramatic reduction in cell growth in both breast cancer and melanoma cells. In melanoma, it causes G1 arrest, which can be reversed by expression of cyclin

Prompt:  S4991 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4991 is a drug that targets the dynein motor. Inhibition of the dynein motor causes collapse of the microtubule cytoskeleton.

Although many of the hits obtained in this screen were validated as dynein inhibitors, the effect on microtubule morphology was inconsistent, with some compounds showing only minor effects and others showing a much more robust effect.

Prompt:  S4994 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4994 is a drug that targets the extracellular domain of the ErbB2 receptor. However, this approach is unlikely to be applicable to other ErbB2-dependent cancers, as ErbB2 is also expressed on normal breast epithelia. To overcome this limitation, we used an alternative approach to target the intracellular domain of ErbB2. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (amino acids 690--719) can bind to the intracellular domain of ErbB2, thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cells ([@bib18]). Our results demonstrate that administration of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 690--719 of ErbB2 into mice can inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells in vivo. The peptide has a relatively short half-life in vivo, suggesting that systemic administration is not feasible. However, local delivery of the peptide using a polymer-

Response: S4996 is a drug that targets caspase-3. It inhibits the activity of caspase-3, which leads to cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis results in the cell death and inhibition of tumor growth. We therefore hypothesize that liraglutide will reduce the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and promote the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by regulating the expression of P2Y12R.

Prompt:  S4999 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S4999 is a drug that targets Lck kinase and is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is a dimer and as such it requires dimerization for its activity. Lck is constitutively associated with the FcγRIIB receptor in the myeloma cells and treatment with S4999 causes internalization of Lck, and as a result of the inhibition of Lck kinase activity, causes a block in the survival of the cells. It has been suggested that the binding of the S4999 dimer to FcγRIIB receptor may induce receptor clustering. This receptor clustering, in turn, may lead to the internalization of the FcγRIIB receptor and the block in the survival of the cells.
The effect of S4999 is not due to the presence of a competitive antagonist of the FcγRIIB receptor. The FcγRIIB

Prompt:  S5005 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5005 is a drug that targets the ABCB1 transporter, an efflux pump that effluxes various lipophilic xenobiotics. It has been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and is currently under investigation for use in various other cancers.

ABCB1 is expressed in a wide range of normal tissues, including the skin, colon, liver, brain, and kidney, and is expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). ABCB1 is a member of the ABC transporter family of membrane proteins, and is the most abundant transporter at the BBB. The transporter is responsible for the efflux of many endogenous compounds, including steroids, bilirubin, leukotriene C4, and bile acids.

Numerous Phase II clinical trials are investigating S5005 for the treatment of brain tumors.

Prompt:  S5007 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5007 is a drug that targets the IL-17 receptor A and B. A study on mice has shown that S5007 significantly decreased neutrophil recruitment in the airways and alveoli, and suppressed neutrophil-derived MMP-9 expression, which indicates that S5007 may be a promising agent for the treatment of ARDS.

In addition, a recent study showed that anti-IL-17A antibody could reduce lung injury in murine endotoxemia models \[[@B12-ijms-19-02208]\]. However, there is still no evidence that the IL-17 pathway is a direct therapeutic target for ARDS.

Prompt:  S5009 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5009 is a drug that targets the high affinity transport system (hAT1) of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by inhibiting the uptake of several compounds including the anti-tumor agent, vincristine (VCR). The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of the S-enantiomer of S5009 on brain tumor growth and intracerebral (i.c.) tumor vasculature. Male rats were stereotactically implanted with a C6 glioma and treated with either S-S5009 or vehicle control. We evaluated the efficacy of S-S5009 to inhibit C6 glioma growth in vivo and also assessed the effect of S-S5009 on BBB permeability in vitro. We demonstrate that S-S5009 is an effective inhibitor of glioma growth in vivo, and that this is associated with a significant reduction in BBB permeability. These data suggest that S-

This drug has been studied in combination with docetaxel, which is a microtubule-targeting agent used in the treatment of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. The results of a phase II study with docetaxel, S5010, and placebo in patients with prostate cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00373967) have recently been reported ([@B53]). The study was designed to determine the toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of S5010 in combination with docetaxel. S5010 was administered intravenously over 1 h, followed by docetaxel administered intravenously over 1 h. S5010 was well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.

Prompt:  S5012 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5012 is a drug that targets B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) to induce apoptosis and cause cell death. We have demonstrated that S5012 is a potent inhibitor of the nuclear export protein, CRM1, by competing with leptomycin B (LMB) for the same binding site in CRM1. Here, we show that S5012 can induce the rapid depletion of CRM1 from the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which leads to the degradation of its target proteins. The mechanism of CRM1 down-regulation by S5012 appears to be distinct from the effects of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The degradation of CRM1 is dependent on the kinase activity of S5012, as demonstrated by the failure of S5012 to deplete CRM1 in cells expressing the CRM1 kinase-dead mutant. Furthermore, the inhibition of CRM1 kinase activity by treatment with

Prompt:  S5013 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5013 is a drug that targets the protein ROR2 (ROR2 is a protein that belongs to the ROR family of orphan nuclear receptors) to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. In the process of ROR2 inhibition, the expression of several downstream genes, such as PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, FGF1, and VEGF, were downregulated in tumor cells. Furthermore, the expression of several stem cell markers, such as CD44, CD133, and ALDH, was also reduced in tumor cells. In the tumor xenograft models, S5013 significantly inhibited tumor growth. These results demonstrate that S5013 is a novel agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

Prompt:  S5014 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5014 is a drug that targets the CDC25C/CDK2 complex. In cell cycle progression, CDC25C is phosphorylated by CDC2 and CDK2 and inactivated by Cdc25C phosphorylation. S5014 inhibits the interaction between CDC25C and CDK2, which results in CDC25C phosphorylation. This phosphorylation inhibits the ability of CDC25C to activate the CDK2-cyclin A complex. CDC25C phosphorylation by S5014 leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.

Response: S5015 is a drug that targets the α4β2-nAChR subtype. It has been shown to increase the function of the β2-nAChR subtype ([@B29]) and inhibit the α4β2-nAChR subtype ([@B31]). Thus, the specific α4β2-nAChR subtype is not fully clear. In this study, S3295, which was designed based on the pharmacophore of S5015, was used to confirm whether the S5015 pharmacophore model is valid. We found that S3295 had similar effects on the reduction of α4β2-nAChR function, which confirmed that S5015 may have potential for the treatment of depression. In the behavioral tests, S3295 significantly increased the time spent in the open arms, increased the number of entries into the open arms, and reduced the time spent in the closed arms, suggesting

Prompt:  S5017 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5017 is a drug that targets Aβ plaques and that prevents amyloid deposition in mouse brains. We showed that S5017 has a high affinity for Aβ aggregates and suppresses the formation of Aβ aggregates in vitro. The oral administration of S5017 significantly reduces Aβ levels in the brains of 5XFAD mice, which are widely used as an animal model of AD. We also showed that S5017 improves the learning and memory of 5XFAD mice. The S5017-mediated suppression of Aβ deposition was also observed in human neuroblastoma cells that overexpress APP and PS1, suggesting that S5017 is a useful drug for the treatment of AD. In addition, S5017 had no effects on neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, or blood-brain barrier permeability in mice, suggesting that S5017 has few side effects.

Response: S5018 is a drug that targets the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of SCF^βTRCP^ by competitively binding to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 and has been shown to induce degradation of substrates including cyclin A and c-Myc.^[@bib31],[@bib32]^ The data presented here show that S5018 treatment led to the accumulation of the neddylated form of Cullin1 in cells treated with S5018 and also in cells overexpressing wild-type but not E3 ubiquitin ligase-dead Cullin1. Furthermore, the increase in neddylated Cullin1 was dependent on the presence of neddylated ubiquitin in the reaction. The data presented here are in agreement with the published data showing that Cullin1 neddylation and subsequent degradation is dependent on the neddylation of ubiquitin.^[

Prompt:  S5025 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5025 is a drug that targets the protein kinase C betaII (PKCβII) isoenzyme. It is a synthetic compound that has been shown to exert an antitumor effect against various tumor cell lines, including gastric, prostate, and colorectal cancers. It has been reported to exert its antitumor effects by inhibiting the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, by promoting tumor cell apoptosis, and by inhibiting angiogenesis.

Response: S5027 is a drug that targets the high-affinity P2Y~2~ receptor \[[@B21-ijms-19-01993]\]. Our study showed that rP2Y~2~R was upregulated in injured bladder tissues of rats. When the rats were treated with S5027, the mRNA and protein levels of P2Y~2~R were significantly decreased, suggesting that the P2Y~2~R was involved in the regulation of neuropathic pain. It is worth noting that the decrease of the mRNA level of P2Y~2~R was more pronounced than that of the protein level, which may be due to the high stability of the mRNA. These results suggested that the regulation of the P2Y~2~R by S5027 could be associated with the treatment of neuropathic pain.

In this study, we demonstrated that the P2Y~2~R was involved in the neuropathic pain

Response: S5033 is a drug that targets the tyrosine kinase Src and that has been reported to block Src-mediated cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo \[[@B28]\]. To investigate whether the observed increase in cell proliferation was a result of increased Src activity, we examined the phosphorylation of Src on Y416 in control and in E7 shRNA-transfected T47D cells. E7 silencing increased the phosphorylation of Src Y416 ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}), suggesting that E7 may negatively regulate Src signaling in breast cancer cells.

Prompt:  S5034 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5034 is a drug that targets the K+ channel protein Kv1.3 and has been developed as a potential treatment for epilepsy and neuropathic pain (Neugebauer et al., [@B26]; Boulter et al., [@B3]). When applied to cultured DRG neurons, S5034 induced a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of action potentials (APs) and depolarized the resting membrane potential. However, S5034 was not effective at inducing action potential firing in cultured spinal cord neurons (data not shown). The specific ionic currents affected by S5034 in DRG neurons have been determined by patch-clamp recordings. S5034 reduced Kv1.3 currents and increased the voltage-gated A-type K^+^ current.

Prompt:  S5037 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5037 is a drug that targets V-ATPase and reduces the uptake of calcium by cells ([@bib30]). The S3061 was used as a negative control for S5037 because it is not an inhibitor of V-ATPase. We found that S5037 could increase the cell surface expression of TfR1, indicating that S5037 is capable of inhibiting V-ATPase and consequently increasing the cell surface expression of TfR1 ([Figure 3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}B). The mechanism of the S5037-induced increase in cell surface TfR1 expression is likely due to the accumulation of TfR1 in the Golgi complex, where it is sorted to the plasma membrane. However, the underlying mechanism needs to be further studied.

In summary, our data demonstrate that V-ATPase and TfR1 are essential for endosomal Tf recycling and

Prompt:  S5048 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5048 is a drug that targets p53 and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of a number of cancers, including colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer ([@bib27]). We tested the effect of S5048 on the levels of phosphorylated p53 in OVCAR-8 cells. We found that S5048 treatment caused a marked decrease in p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 in a dose-dependent manner ([Figure 2A](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}).

In addition to phosphorylation, the levels of p53 are regulated by its stability. The turnover of p53 is dependent on its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation ([@bib1]). To investigate the effect of S5048 on the turnover of p53, we treated OVCAR-8 cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein synthesis. We

Prompt:  S5051 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5051 is a drug that targets the L-type calcium channels. We found that S5051 reduced the viability of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the viability of normal astrocytes was not affected by S5051. Furthermore, S5051 suppressed glioma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. S5051 induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and decreased the protein levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2. The induction of cell cycle arrest by S5051 was blocked by L-type calcium channel blockers and siRNA against Cav1.3. Finally, S5051 reduced the tumor volume of orthotopic xenograft glioma in nude mice. In summary, we demonstrate that S5051 has a potent anti-glioma activity in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that S5051 might be a potential candidate for the treatment of glioma.

Response: S5052 is a drug that targets the sodium channel. Its role in pain and epilepsy has been established. However, its role in other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer\'s disease, Parkinson\'s disease and depression, is unknown. Here we show that S5052 is not only active in models of epilepsy, but also in models of Alzheimer\'s disease and depression. These studies, together with the discovery that S5052 can protect against kainic acid induced excitotoxicity, highlight the potential for this compound as a novel treatment for epilepsy, and also in other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Prompt:  S5056 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5056 is a drug that targets the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R) and has shown activity against multiple myeloma. The objectives of this study were to determine the toxicity of S5056 when administered with radiotherapy and to determine the optimal timing of administration. In the first part of the study, rats received single doses of S5056 or vehicle, at different time intervals, before or after single-dose radiation exposure. The median lethal dose (LD(50)) of S5056 was 1.4 mg/kg, whereas that of vehicle was greater than 10 mg/kg. For the second part of the study, two groups of animals were exposed to single-dose radiation (4 Gy) at different time intervals (before or after) and received different doses of S5056.

Prompt:  S5058 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5058 is a drug that targets VDAC1, a mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1). VDAC1 is an integral membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and a large, integral part of the permeability transition pore complex. The pore complex is a complex of proteins that mediate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria during apoptosis. Once released, cytochrome c initiates the caspase cascade and triggers cell death. VDAC1 is also a receptor for a number of bacterial toxins, including the beta-barrel pore forming proteins, the *E. coli* cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF1) and the *Yersinia* YopM. These proteins bind to the protein N-terminal domain of VDAC1 and act as ligands to trigger cell death.

Response: S5059 is a drug that targets Aurora A and is currently in clinical trials. However, S-trityl-[S]-4-morpholine-2-methylpropanethiosulfonate bromide (S4) ([Figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}) is a more selective and potent inhibitor of Aurora A than S5059, as it is a non-peptidomimetic compound. Furthermore, S4 does not exhibit toxicity in cancer cells and it can be readily synthesized and purified. In the present study, we demonstrated that S4 is an effective and selective inhibitor of Aurora A in cancer cells.

Aurora A is a serine/threonine kinase, and its aberrant expression and activity have been associated with various types of human cancer, including lung, colon, breast, gastric, pancreatic, bladder, and liver cancers. It has been demonstrated that Aurora A overexpression

Prompt:  S5063 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5063 is a drug that targets the TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1) and was first developed by Schering-Plough in 2001 ([@B31]). The drug is a dimer of a human TNF receptor fused to a non-covalently linked IgG1-Fc fragment and binds TNFα with high affinity. The molecule is a potent and specific inhibitor of TNFα signaling in all cells expressing TNFR1 ([@B32]). The main role of this drug is to suppress the production of TNFα and other cytokines in the inflammatory cascade. As such, the drug can inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cell death. In addition, the drug can modulate the activity of T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and inhibit neutrophil migration and endothelial adhesion ([@B33]).

Prompt:  S5067 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5067 is a drug that targets mitochondrial DNA and thus inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and reduces the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When this happens, it causes the death of cancer cells. By contrast, normal cells are not affected because they have a different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence that is not affected by S-5067. This is a good thing, because S-5067 is not a specific cancer drug and could cause damage to healthy cells.

### **Mimicking the natural mitochondrial environment**

One of the most common approaches to treating cancer is to deprive the cancer cells of the oxygen that they need to grow and divide. This deprives them of the ATP that they need to function, so it is not a pleasant treatment. Nevertheless, depriving the cancer cells of oxygen is an effective way of killing them. Unfortunately, this is a difficult treatment to administer, because the cancer cells also need oxygen to grow and divide.

Prompt:  S5074 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5074 is a drug that targets the mitochondrial enzyme complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC) \[[@B9-cancers-12-01168]\]. The main function of the ETC is the generation of ATP from nutrients by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport chain consists of four complexes, namely complexes I, II, III and IV. NADH and FADH2, two reducing equivalents from the oxidation of nutrients, are utilized by complex I to reduce molecular oxygen to water \[[@B9-cancers-12-01168]\]. Subsequently, the reduced oxygen is transferred to complex II, which reduces molecular oxygen to water by transferring electrons to the ubiquinone. Next, complex III transfers electrons from ubiquinone to molecular oxygen, which results in the generation of water. Complex IV then reduces molecular oxygen to water by transferring electrons to the cytochrome c \[[@B9-cancers-12-01

Prompt:  S5077 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5077 is a drug that targets mitochondria and acts as an anti-apoptotic agent, therefore it may have therapeutic potential in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of S5077 against MPP+ and Aβ25-35-induced neurotoxicity in primary cortical cultures. We found that S5077 protected against both neurotoxins. Moreover, S5077 reduced the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as shown by decreased Bax translocation and caspase-3 activation. S5077 increased the expression of Bcl-2 and the phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Akt. Finally, we demonstrated that the protective effects of S5077 against the neurotoxic insults are mediated by the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and by the preservation of mitochondrial function.

Prompt:  S5086 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5086 is a drug that targets HIF-1alpha, a protein that is normally upregulated in cancer cells when they are in an oxygen-deprived environment. The drug does not kill cancer cells directly, but makes them more susceptible to cell death.

The study, published online May 30 in the journal Nature Medicine, showed that S5086 could be effective against lung cancer in a preclinical model.

The researchers used two different types of cancer cells, one from a lung cancer patient and the other from a cancer cell line. Both types of cancer cells were grown in tissue culture and then exposed to different concentrations of S5086. After exposure, the researchers observed cell death in both types of cells.

The researchers then grew a human lung cancer cell line in mice. When the mice were treated with S5086, the researchers observed that the cancer cells were killed.

Prompt:  S5087 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5087 is a drug that targets the HIF pathway. The results from the present study are consistent with a previous study, which reported that SID525 can target the HIF pathway to inhibit the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and VEGF.[@b24-dddt-12-2223] Therefore, SID525 may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NPC.

The present study also investigated the antitumor effects of SID525 on NPC xenografts in vivo. The results showed that SID525 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner and the growth of xenografts was significantly reduced compared with the control group. These results suggest that SID525 may have potential antitumor activity in NPC.

In conclusion, the present study showed that SID525 can inhibit NPC cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of S

Prompt:  S5091 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5091 is a drug that targets HMG-CoA reductase and is a potent statin. In a recent report, Dasgupta et al. \[[@CR1]\] investigated the pharmacological activity of S-4541, a derivative of S-4591, in a model of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. The authors showed that S-4541 reduced mechanical hyperalgesia in a rat model of chronic peripheral neuropathy induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. The authors demonstrated that S-4541 improved the nociceptive behavior, without altering the locomotor function of the animals. In addition, the beneficial effects of S-4541 were associated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and CREB, suggesting that S-4541 might act through the modulation of the ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathways. The beneficial effects of S-

Prompt:  S5092 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5092 is a drug that targets the nAChR, an ion channel that mediates fast synaptic transmission and is a target for many analgesic and anesthetic drugs. It has been suggested that the clinical efficacy of nAChR ligands is mediated by their ability to potentiate cholinergic signaling in the brain. As such, they are effective in the treatment of pain, depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders.^[@ref1]^ The *N*-methyl-[d]{.smallcaps}-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a heterotetrameric protein complex that plays an important role in mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). The NMDA receptor is blocked by the drug ketamine, which is a potent anesthetic that also has antidepressant properties.^[@ref2]^ Ketamine is also used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and it is an approved treatment

Prompt:  S5093 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5093 is a drug that targets a host of tyrosine kinases, including Flt3 and KDR/VEGFR2, both of which are implicated in the maintenance of leukemic stem cells. As mentioned above, the kinase inhibitor Sorafenib is currently used in the clinic for the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia, and we have demonstrated that it is effective in reducing the viability of a subset of patient-derived xenograft models of BCR-ABL-positive ALL \[[@R1]\]. The effects of Sorafenib on ALL are mediated through multiple mechanisms, including downregulation of tyrosine kinase activity and activation of the transcription factor Foxo3a \[[@R1]\]. Sorafenib has also been shown to inhibit the growth of primary patient-derived xenograft models of T-ALL \[[@R2]\]. We and others have demonstrated that Soraf

Prompt:  S5096 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5096 is a drug that targets the RhoA/ROCK pathway. The current study showed that IWR-S5096 alone had no effect on the viability of DU145 and PC3 cells. However, IWR-S5096 treatment significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin on both cell lines, and significantly reduced the viability of PC3 cells.

In addition, the anti-tumor activity of IWR-S5096 was significantly enhanced in combination with cisplatin. The results indicated that the synergistic effect of IWR-S5096 and cisplatin was greater in DU145 cells than in PC3 cells. It was also shown that the IWR-S5096 and cisplatin combination significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells in a synergistic manner.

Response: S5097 is a drug that targets the tyrosine kinase (TK) encoded by the EphA2 receptor, which is overexpressed in various cancers, including those of the breast, colon, lung, head and neck, prostate, and ovary. S-targeted EphA2 kinase inhibitors can be administered in various routes, including orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, and intratumorally, but they have been shown to exhibit poor systemic bioavailability (e.g., Gewirtz, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 91:3051-3055 (1994)). In addition, S-targeted EphA2 kinase inhibitors have shown little antitumor activity in xenograft tumor models (e.g., Murphy, et al., Oncogene. 20:4516-4524 (2001)).

Prompt:  S5098 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5098 is a drug that targets ribosomal RNA and is designed to inhibit protein synthesis. The drug binds to the large ribosomal subunit and interferes with the initiation of translation by interfering with the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome \[[@CR33]\]. This drug is one of the few agents that specifically targets the large ribosomal subunit and is thought to be less toxic than the classic purine analogs such as puromycin \[[@CR34]\]. Preclinical studies in a wide range of cancer models, including those with limited treatment options, have shown that S-S5098 induces cell death by apoptosis \[[@CR35]\]. Furthermore, preclinical studies in a number of tumor types have demonstrated synergistic effects when S-S5098 is combined with other agents, such as cisplatin \[[@CR36]\], gemcitabine \[[@CR37

Response: S5100 is a drug that targets BCL-2 and BCL-XL. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of BCL-2 and BCL-XL with activity in both apoptosis and necrosis in a variety of cancer cell lines. Preclinical studies in several animal models of human cancers, including small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer, and neuroblastoma, have demonstrated activity of S5100 in preclinical models of human cancers. It is active in both wild-type and BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor-resistant cell lines and induces apoptosis and tumor regression in vivo. The Phase I clinical trial of S5100 in advanced cancer patients demonstrated that S5100 was well tolerated at doses of 50-200 mg/m(2) in an outpatient setting. The pharmacokinetic profile of S5100 was dose proportional and consistent with a two-compartment model. S5100 was rapidly absorbed

Response: S5102 is a drug that targets LTR. The ability of S5102 to reverse the CXCR4-dependent effects of SDF-1 on the movement of BMMCs through CXCL12/CXCR4 chemotaxis assays ([Figure 2A](#F2){ref-type="fig"}) was examined. S5102 reversed the migration of BMMCs from SDF-1 treated groups ([Figure 2B](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). The number of migrated cells in the control group was significantly greater than in the SDF-1-treated group (*p* \< 0.05). However, S5102 treatment of the SDF-1-treated group did not show a significant difference from the control group (*p* \> 0.05). In addition, BMMCs were treated with S5102 to determine whether it could reverse the effects of SDF-1 on calcium mobilization.

Response: S5103 is a drug that targets c-Met in HCC. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of this drug on HCC cells. A CCK8 assay was performed to examine the effect of S5103 on HCC cells proliferation. We found that S5103 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value of S5103 on HepG2 and Bel7402 cells was 4.5μM and 2.5μM respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate. We found that S5103 significantly induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and promoted apoptosis. We further detected the expression of c-Met in HepG2 and Bel7402 cells and found that the expression of c-Met was decreased after S5103 treatment. In conclusion, S5103 has a potent anti-proliferation effect on HCC cells and may induce cell cycle

Prompt:  S5108 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5108 is a drug that targets an enzyme that causes a rapid increase in levels of cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate). In the cells of the body, cAMP levels control many functions, including the release of hormones that regulate appetite and energy use. The researchers hypothesized that S5108 might reduce appetite by causing the brain to be less hungry, or by reducing food intake after eating.

After being fed a diet of highly palatable foods, rats given S5108 showed reduced intake of both palatable foods and standard chow, as well as reduced appetite. These results suggest that S5108 reduces food intake by reducing appetite, not by reducing the desire to eat.

Because the brain regulates appetite, the researchers also tested whether S5108 affects appetite by targeting receptors in the brain. They found that S5108 does not bind to the receptors that regulate appetite, suggesting that it does not act directly on the brain.

Prompt:  S5112 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5112 is a drug that targets the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and is used to treat the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has been demonstrated to have a range of immunosuppressive effects on B cells, macrophages, and T cells in preclinical models. However, its immunosuppressive effects on B cells are not well characterized. Here, we describe a detailed study of the effect of S5112 on the B cell repertoire and on B cell-mediated immune responses. We show that S5112 treatment leads to a reduction in B cell numbers in the spleen and bone marrow, as well as to a reduced frequency of B cells in the lymph nodes. We demonstrate that the decrease in B cells in S5112-treated mice is due to increased apoptosis and not due to reduced B cell development. Furthermore, we show that S5112 treatment has

In the current study, we explored the antitumor effects of S5113 on glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that S5113 induced apoptosis in glioma cells and inhibited the proliferation of U251 and U87 cells. Furthermore, S5113 inhibited tumor growth in U251 and U87 xenograft tumor models. Moreover, S5113 treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways in tumor tissues. Our results demonstrated that S5113 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and that it may be a potential candidate for the treatment of glioma.

Prompt:  S5119 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5119 is a drug that targets the CXCR4 receptor. In addition, it has been reported that the drug is useful for prevention and treatment of infections and cancers ([@bib17]). The development of novel CXCR4 antagonists with high potency, selectivity, and efficacy has become a major goal in medicinal chemistry. To date, more than 20 structurally diverse CXCR4 antagonists have been identified. Among them, AMD3100 and AMD3100 derivatives are known to have high affinity and selectivity for CXCR4. AMD3100, a peptidomimetic antagonist, is a selective inhibitor of CXCR4 ([@bib13]). In particular, AMD3100 derivatives have been developed for their enhanced binding affinity and improved pharmacokinetic properties.

Prompt:  S5121 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5121 is a drug that targets the M2 subunit of the ribosome. M2 has two functions: it is an allosteric inhibitor of eIF2a, a protein necessary for protein synthesis, and it binds directly to the 50S ribosomal subunit, where it inhibits the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome.

M2-S5121 was previously in phase I clinical trials, and this trial demonstrated that it was well-tolerated and could cross the blood-brain barrier. However, the drug was discontinued because of safety concerns in another trial. The trial in which it was discontinued showed that it could not cross the blood-brain barrier. M2-S5121 has been re-purposed as a treatment for depression. It is thought that it may have an effect on serotonin receptors in the brain.

Prompt:  S5131 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5131 is a drug that targets the SLC11A1 transporter. It is not approved for use in the US.

In vivo:

S5131 has been shown to have potent activity in the rat, with an ED50 of 1.9 mg/kg.

Toxicity:

S5131 is well tolerated in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. It has been shown to have a similar toxicity profile to clozapine.

In summary, the evidence presented here suggests that S5131 has potential as a novel antipsychotic agent.

Abstract

Clozapine has a relatively long half-life and is therefore frequently used in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. However, clozapine also has a number of undesirable side effects. A new antipsychotic with fewer side effects is therefore needed.

5. Conclusion {#s0055}
=============

In summary, we have discovered a novel mechanism of action for S5136 and provide evidence for the inhibition of BK~Ca~ channels by this compound. S5136 is a selective and highly potent inhibitor of BK~Ca~ channels with no effect on Kv7.1 channels. The compound also exhibits excellent efficacy and good tolerability in rodent models of bronchoconstriction, atopic dermatitis, and experimental arthritis. We anticipate that S5136 will be a useful tool to further understand the physiological role of BK~Ca~ channels in various disease models and to facilitate development of more selective and effective therapeutics.

Prompt:  S5138 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5138 is a drug that targets Kv1.3, a potassium channel that is expressed in a subset of T cells. S5138 was developed by Sanofi-Aventis (now part of sanofi-aventis), but it has since been acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals. In phase 1 studies, S5138 was safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The drug reduced the number of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and improved clinical outcomes in MS patients. However, because S5138 blocks the Kv1.3 channel, which is expressed in T cells, S5138 also suppresses T-cell function and causes a loss of immune surveillance. S5138 also has a long half-life, which means that it must be administered frequently, a feature that may increase the risk of infection.

Response: S5143 is a drug that targets the activation of Rac1. We tested its efficacy in our system by adding it at the onset of infection. As shown in [Figure 4](#fig4){ref-type="fig"}D, inhibition of Rac1 by S5143 treatment significantly decreased the production of infectious virions at all time points, indicating that Rac1 is an essential factor for the production of infectious virions in this cell line.

Since Rac1 activation is important for the production of infectious virions, we asked whether a decrease in the expression of the Rac1 GTPase would affect the production of infectious virions. Therefore, we downregulated Rac1 expression using shRNA-Rac1. To validate the efficacy of Rac1 knockdown, we checked the expression of Rac1 protein by western blotting.

Prompt:  S5163 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5163 is a drug that targets the endoplasmic reticulum and is currently being tested in a phase I clinical trial. Its mechanism of action is to promote ER stress, which in turn activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and leads to a rapid decrease in ERAD activity. This causes an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and triggers a type of cell death called ER stress-induced cell death (ERSCD). The UPR is a cellular stress response that is triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.^[@R43]^

ERSCD has been described in various cancers, including HNSCC, and was shown to be mediated by the CHOP protein, a transcription factor downstream of the UPR.^[@R44]^ As a result of ERSCD, cells are forced to halt protein synthesis, decrease protein folding, and re-direct misfolded proteins into the ER-associated degradation

Prompt:  S5174 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5174 is a drug that targets the dendritic cells (DCs) and inhibits the DC-induced maturation of T cells, which could be used as an effective treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients receiving bone marrow transplantation (BMT) \[[@B54-molecules-24-00387]\].

Prompt:  S5203 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5203 is a drug that targets the Src family kinase Lyn and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in many human cancer cells. We recently reported that S5203 is a potent inhibitor of melanoma cell migration and invasion, and that it suppresses melanoma metastasis in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that the mechanism of action of S5203 is mediated by induction of E-cadherin and suppression of N-cadherin, leading to inhibition of cell motility. Inhibition of N-cadherin is mediated by the MAPK signaling pathway, which regulates transcriptional activation of E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Our findings identify S5203 as a new inhibitor of melanoma cell motility that acts by down-regulating N-cadherin.

Prompt:  S5205 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5205 is a drug that targets HDAC6 (see [Fig. 1](#f0005){ref-type="fig"}), which is overexpressed in multiple cancers, including colorectal cancer. As a result, this class of HDAC inhibitors is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of multiple cancers, including lung, prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer [@b0085].

In addition to its catalytic activity, HDAC6 has been shown to interact with several other proteins. A recent study identified HDAC6 as a protein that is targeted by the oncogenic protein v-Src, and suggested that HDAC6 plays a role in tumorigenesis [@b0090]. HDAC6 was also found to be associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and this interaction was shown to mediate EGFR-induced nuclear localization of HDAC6 [@b0095]. HDAC6

Prompt:  S5206 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5206 is a drug that targets the transporter of the glycoprotein and therefore the glycoprotein would be expected to accumulate at the surface of the cell. In contrast, the gp120 in combination with CD4 and CXCR4 would be expected to accumulate in the cytoplasm of the cell. To test this prediction, we stained infected cells with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the gp120. As predicted, in the presence of CD4 and CXCR4, the gp120 staining is mostly cytoplasmic ([Fig. 6](#F6){ref-type="fig"}*A*). In contrast, in the absence of CD4 and CXCR4, the gp120 staining is primarily at the surface of the cell. Thus, the accumulation of the gp120 in the presence of CD4 and CXCR4 is consistent with the gp120 being internalized. The accumulation of gp120 in the presence of CD

Prompt:  S5208 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5208 is a drug that targets the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). It was designed to mimic the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on neurons and has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of tumors. It is currently being studied in phase II clinical trials for treatment of patients with glioblastoma. Here, we have investigated the effects of S5208 on various cell lines and primary glioblastoma cells and found that it has a differential effect on cell proliferation and migration. We show that S5208 inhibits proliferation of glioblastoma cells by promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, S5208 inhibits migration of glioblastoma cells by altering the actin cytoskeleton and altering the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin. This suggests that S5208 may have a role in reducing the invasiveness of glioblastoma

Prompt:  S5209 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5209 is a drug that targets FcγRIIB, a receptor expressed by B cells, and is thought to induce apoptosis in B cells ([@B43]). As described in more detail in [Supplementary Information](#SM1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}, we have found that S5209 is highly toxic to T cells and macrophages, but only mildly toxic to T cells and neutrophils. We believe that S5209 is too toxic to use for a clinical trial and so we did not pursue it further.

Prompt:  S5213 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5213 is a drug that targets histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). The effects of S5213 are reversible. As the name implies, it is a reversible inhibitor of HDAC3. In fact, S5213 binds to the HDAC3 protein and inhibits its activity, which in turn results in an increase in acetylated histones and, thus, increased transcription of the genes that contain acetylated histones \[[@B58-ijms-20-00324]\]. As discussed above, HDAC3 has been linked to the inhibition of caspase-3 activity and induction of apoptosis \[[@B57-ijms-20-00324]\]. As a result, S5213 has the potential to induce apoptosis of cells with *TP53* mutations. To this end, the ability of S5213 to induce apoptosis was assessed in cell lines that carry *TP53* mutations and found to

SUMMARY
=======

We present a systematic study of the expression and functional analysis of the set of proteins in the SAGA/TIP60 complex, and of the phenotypic and genetic alterations of their disruption in human cells. Our analysis indicates that the SAGA/TIP60 complex has a dual role in cancer: first, in supporting tumor growth by stabilizing mRNAs that promote cell proliferation; second, in supporting tumor suppression by preventing oncogenic transformation. In the first case, the complex seems to promote the growth of human cancer cells by stabilizing mRNAs that regulate proliferation. In the second case, the complex seems to be part of a tumor suppressor pathway that is lost in cancer. Our findings suggest that

Prompt:  S5227 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5227 is a drug that targets a protein kinase, FAK (focal adhesion kinase), and is a promising therapeutic for melanoma. However, the anticancer efficacy of S5227 has not been demonstrated in vivo, and there are no published data regarding the mechanism of its action in melanoma. We investigated the effects of S5227 on the growth and motility of melanoma cells. The anticancer efficacy of S5227 was determined in two human melanoma cell lines (WM-115 and WM-266-4) and one normal human melanocyte line (NHM). The growth of melanoma cells was significantly inhibited by S5227, and S5227 was also effective in the growth of NHM. Cell cycle analysis revealed that S5227 arrested melanoma cells in the G1 phase. S5227 treatment also induced the expression of cyclin D1 and p21, but not p27, in melanoma cells. In addition, S

Prompt:  S5229 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5229 is a drug that targets the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, which are essential for the growth of cancer cells. We have previously reported that S5229 treatment of CRC cells induced autophagy, which in turn inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death.[@b32-bctt-7-021] In the current study, we found that S5229 treatment induced apoptosis in both LOVO and HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the S5229-induced apoptosis was mediated by the caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 protein downregulation. We also found that S5229 treatment of LOVO and HT-29 cells led to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. These data suggest that S5229-induced apoptosis was mediated by the inhibition of the Akt and Erk pathways.

Response: S5232 is a drug that targets Nrf2 by competing with its Keap1 inhibitor, bardoxolone, and has been reported to induce autophagy in both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells.^[@CR40],[@CR41]^ As autophagy induction has been reported to be essential for tumor cell survival in hypoxic conditions,^[@CR42]^ this could also explain the observed induction of autophagy by CCI-779 in these cells.

While the efficacy of bardoxolone in inhibiting the growth of both CRC and GIST cell lines in vitro was confirmed, bardoxolone treatment in vivo was less effective than the two standard treatments used in this study, which is likely due to the lower doses used and the relatively high toxicity of the drug in mice.

Prompt:  S5234 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5234 is a drug that targets the cell cycle and cell death, but also suppresses the growth of glioblastoma stem cells. In this study, we found that CDK1 was essential for the S5234-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Our results showed that the expression of CDK1 was significantly increased after treatment with S5234. Therefore, we investigated the effects of S5234 on the phosphorylation of CDK1. The data showed that the phosphorylation of CDK1 was significantly increased in the presence of S5234. In addition, we found that S5234-induced apoptosis was blocked by a specific inhibitor of CDK1, roscovitine, which confirmed the critical role of CDK1 in S5234-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that the inhibition of CDK1 could sensitize the glioblastoma cells to S5234.

Prompt:  S5238 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5238 is a drug that targets the MRP1 transporter and is a substrate of the ABCG2 transporter, thereby potentially limiting the efficacy of the drug in these cases. For all other scenarios, this will likely be less of a concern. However, the likelihood of cross-resistance with other agents is of significant concern. It is also important to remember that there are many more MRP1 and ABCG2 inhibitors in the pipeline and these will likely come to market in the future. It is unlikely that these will be restricted to use in MDR cancer.

There is a need to have a robust discussion about the use of ABCG2 inhibitors in the clinic. If these are to be used for any purpose, it is imperative that we determine their clinical role. As these are ATP-dependent transporters, they will not be suitable for use as chemosensitizers. There is a clear role for the development of new targeted therapies in patients with ABCG2

Discussion {#Sec8}
==========

This study demonstrated that the drug resistance of CML cells to imatinib was significantly enhanced by combining the low-dose DAS with BMSCs. The expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in K562 cells was significantly increased by imatinib treatment. When CML cells were treated with low-dose DAS and imatinib together, the expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 was further increased. This phenomenon may be associated with the induction of p53 and p21 expression by imatinib and DAS.

DAS has been reported to inhibit ABCB1 expression in CML cells \[[@CR13]\]. However, a previous study has shown that ABCB1 expression is inhibited in a p53-dependent manner \[[@CR14]\]. Therefore, we investigated whether the combination

Response: S5241 is a drug that targets the nociceptive TRPV1 receptor, and is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy ([@bib33]; [@bib41]). It was also recently shown that TRPV1 receptor activation in keratinocytes sensitizes them to mechanical stress, and that the compound reduces the mechanical threshold in mouse hind paws ([@bib24]).

Because TRPV1 receptors are activated by noxious heat, the thermal threshold of the paw is reduced following injection of the compound ([@bib41]). However, we have also observed a dramatic decrease in mechanical sensitivity following treatment with the compound. This is similar to the reduction in mechanical sensitivity observed in TRPV1 knockout mice ([@bib15]; [@bib40]).

Prompt:  S5248 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5248 is a drug that targets the Smad2/3 pathway and is used to treat several diseases including pancreatic cancer. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of Smad2/3 pathway inhibition by YS5248, we first treated BxPC-3 cells with YS5248 and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate changes in gene expression. The sequencing results showed that the most enriched pathway affected by YS5248 was the TGF-β signaling pathway. To validate the results of RNA-seq, we examined the expression of the TGF-β target genes Smad7 and TGF-β2 in the presence of YS5248. The expression of both Smad7 and TGF-β2 was increased by YS5248 treatment (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}A). To determine whether YS5248 directly affects the TGF-β pathway, we treated BxPC-

Prompt:  S5250 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5250 is a drug that targets the metabolism of sirtuins and the neuroprotective action of sirtuins. The overall goal of this project is to determine the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of S5250 in the treatment of Huntington's disease. This project is a collaborative effort between the New York University School of Medicine and Genzyme Corporation. We have successfully synthesized S5250 and shown that it is a potent inhibitor of the deacetylation of both SIRT1 and SIRT2 in vitro. S5250 has the potential to be a potent and selective drug to treat Huntington's disease. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) synthesize a series of S5250 analogs and determine their potency in vitro; 2) determine the potency of S5250 and analogs in a cell-based assay for sirtuin activity; 3) determine the PK properties of S5250 and analogs; 4) determine the safety and tolerability of

Response: S5252 is a drug that targets both ATR and CHK1. We have found that S5252 induces cell death in BRCA-deficient cells with features of mitotic catastrophe. These results suggest that BRCA-deficient cells are particularly vulnerable to agents that block DNA replication.

BRCA1 has been reported to regulate the levels of a number of proteins that are involved in the response to replication stress ([@B34],[@B37],[@B39],[@B40]). For example, it has been reported that BRCA1 is a substrate for ATM, which phosphorylates BRCA1 in response to replication stress and facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation ([@B40],[@B41]). ATM also phosphorylates BRCA1 to regulate the stability of RAD51 and the recruitment of RAD51 to the sites of stalled replication forks ([@B34],[@B39]). BRCA1 has also

Prompt:  S5255 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5255 is a drug that targets the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, the synergistic effect of ZOL and TPL on inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells may be related to the ERK1/2 pathway. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that ZOL and TPL synergistically inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells by increasing the apoptosis of cancer cells \[[@CR18]--[@CR20]\]. Our data demonstrated that the synergistic effect of ZOL and TPL on inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells was mediated by apoptosis.

In conclusion, our data demonstrated that ZOL combined with TPL synergistically inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells, and this synergistic effect may be mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway. These findings provide new insight into the clinical treatment of breast cancer.

Our findings showed that S5256-induced apoptosis in PC9 cells was associated with upregulation of CHK1 and CHK2, and inhibition of CHK1 and CHK2 reduced S5256-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, CHK1/2 deficiency enhanced S5256-induced apoptosis in PC9 cells.

Our data showed that CHK1/2 deficiency reduced S5256-induced upregulation of p-CHK1, p-CHK2 and p-H2AX. In addition, CHK1/2 deficiency increased the S5256-induced decrease in cyclin B1 and p-Cdc2. Moreover, S5256 treatment increased the percentage of G2/M-phase cells and the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase, and decreased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase.

Prompt:  S5257 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5257 is a drug that targets the microtubule protein (MT) tubulin. It interferes with the ability of MTs to polymerize into microtubules. This results in abnormal MTs that are unable to sustain cellular function.^[@R4]^ There are two main types of MTs: dynamic and stable. Stable MTs are found in neuronal axons and dendrites, whereas dynamic MTs are found in the dendritic spines of neurons.^[@R5]^ S5257 selectively disrupts the function of stable MTs and thereby disables synapses and reduces spine density.^[@R6]^

S5257 binds to the β-tubulin dimer, and therefore the drug is able to inhibit the growth of MTs, but not their shrinkage.^[@R4]^ When used in patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the drug is able to

Response: S5258 is a drug that targets the *E. coli* ribosome and was found to inhibit the growth of multiple gram-negative bacterial strains \[[@B44-viruses-12-00850]\]. Therefore, we also examined the effect of ribosome inhibition on the interaction between the IAV PB2 protein and the Nsp3 N-terminal domain. Indeed, S5258 inhibited the interaction between the PB2 protein and the Nsp3 N-terminal domain ([Figure 5](#viruses-12-00850-f005){ref-type="fig"}D). This result indicates that ribosome inhibition might affect the interaction between the PB2 protein and the Nsp3 N-terminal domain, and thus affect the binding of the Nsp3 N-terminal domain to the PB2 protein.

Prompt:  S5261 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5261 is a drug that targets Ras signaling.

It was originally identified as an inhibitor of Ras farnesyltransferase, an enzyme involved in post-translational modification of Ras proteins.  This modification is necessary for the interaction of Ras with its effectors and membrane localization.

As a result of the development of this drug, the prenylation of Ras proteins has become an important target for the treatment of cancers.

The primary target of S5261 is farnesyltransferase.  Farnesyltransferase adds a farnesyl group to Ras proteins.

Ras farnesyltransferase has two other substrates besides Ras, one is the prenyltransferase (FTase), the other is the Ras-related protein 1A (R-Ras).

Prompt:  S5266 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5266 is a drug that targets mTOR and acts as a radiosensitizer. Recently, the synergistic effects of S5266 with ionizing radiation have been investigated in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the combined effects of S5266 and X-rays in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. The combination of S5266 and X-rays caused synergistic cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. S5266 inhibited the activation of mTOR and downregulated the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, including S6K1, 4E-BP1 and Akt. Moreover, S5266 sensitized U2OS cells to X-ray-induced cell death and promoted the activation of caspase-3. Our data suggest that the combination of S5266 and X-rays may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

In the same study, no responses were observed in melanoma patients with BRAF wild-type disease, suggesting that BRAF inhibition alone is insufficient for melanoma treatment. Moreover, no responses were observed in BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer, although one patient had a prolonged partial response.[@R23] However, a recently published phase I study in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma demonstrated a manageable safety profile, an objective response rate of 27% and a disease control rate of 74% (response rate of 42%).

Prompt:  S5288 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5288 is a drug that targets the type 2 isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3K family of enzymes is a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is a key second messenger that activates a variety of protein kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), which then activate multiple signaling pathways that promote cell survival and proliferation (reviewed in [@bib29]). LY294002 is a PI3K inhibitor that competes with ATP for binding to the active site of the enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity blocks phosphorylation of the lipid product of PI3K and hence blocks downstream signaling pathways.

Response: S5289 is a drug that targets ALK (ALK^F1174L^) and ALK^F1174L^ is also a common oncogenic driver of lung cancer ([@R28]). Using the ALK^F1174L^ lung cancer model, we have shown that both agents have *in vivo* anti-tumor activity against NSCLC with this ALK oncogene ([@R30]). The current study demonstrates that ALK^F1174L^ NSCLC cells are more sensitive to ALK inhibitors than are the other lung cancer cell lines. These results are consistent with previous reports that lung cancer cell lines harboring the ALK oncogene were more sensitive to ALK inhibitors than were other lung cancer cell lines ([@R31]). This increased sensitivity may be due to the presence of the *ALK* oncogene and/or a gene amplification of *ALK* in lung cancer cell lines ([@R32]).

Prompt:  S5298 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5298 is a drug that targets S6K1 and also inhibits S6K2. It has been used in preclinical studies and shown to reduce the expression of the proteins of interest in the tumor. In addition, S6K1 is required for the activation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation and tumor growth, while S6K2 is known to regulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E.

In our study, the combinatorial inhibition of mTOR and S6K1 reduced the expression of all proteins involved in the AKT/mTOR/S6K1/S6K2/eIF4E axis. The phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K1 was reduced and the expression of p70S6K was reduced. The phosphorylation of eIF4E and the expression of eIF4E were also reduced. These findings suggest that combinatorial inhibition of mTOR and S6K1 may inhibit

Prompt:  S5299 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5299 is a drug that targets the Src family kinase Lyn, but which can also target other Src family kinases such as Fyn. It was used in these studies to prevent the upregulation of Fyn, a non-Src kinase, following withdrawal of IL-6.

The present data are in agreement with the notion that the inhibition of JAK2 and pSTAT3 can promote the apoptosis of IL-6-treated MSCs. A recent study has shown that JAK2 inhibitor AG490 can induce the apoptosis of human MSCs. The authors reported that the treatment of MSCs with AG490 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, leading to the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [@B24]. In the present study, we also found that JAK2

Prompt:  S5302 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5302 is a drug that targets the ERAD pathway, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, and the protein disulfide isomerase ERp57. The N-terminal coiled-coil domain of ERp57 binds to the luminal domain of HRD1. This interaction leads to ubiquitination of the ERAD substrate HRD1 by the RING-CH-IBR domain of HRD1. S5302 prevents this interaction and prevents the degradation of HRD1, resulting in increased HRD1 activity and proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins. S5302 was developed as a novel treatment for various diseases and disorders, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. The discovery of S5302 has recently been covered by several publications. The discovery of S5302 was initially reported in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0101574 and 2008/019

Prompt:  S5305 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5305 is a drug that targets the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. However, the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Our study suggests that the cytotoxic effects of S5305 are mediated through the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and are independent of Bax and Bak expression. This study also showed that S5305 could overcome drug resistance and may serve as a potential treatment for drug-resistant CML.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of S5305 on the growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. S5305 was shown to significantly inhibit the growth of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that S5305 induces apoptosis in K562 cells, as indicated by Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. In addition, S5305 was shown to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Western blot analysis showed that S5305 treatment induced the cleavage

This drug was found to increase the phosphorylation of Tau, suggesting that it might also increase phosphorylation of Tau in humans. To test this possibility, we assessed Tau phosphorylation in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls, after S5311 treatment. We found no differences in the phosphorylation of Tau in either patients or controls. These data suggest that S5311 does not increase Tau phosphorylation in the human brain.

S5325 induced apoptosis in both promyelocytic HL-60 cells and in primary human myeloid cells, as assessed by Annexin-V staining, PARP cleavage and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, S5325 did not induce apoptosis in either monocytic THP-1 cells or lymphoid Jurkat T cells. S5325 induced caspase-independent cell death in HL-60 cells, as well as a G1 arrest in HL-60 cells and primary myeloid cells. S5325 also induced a G2/M arrest in THP-1 cells. In addition

Prompt:  S5326 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5326 is a drug that targets protein S-sulfenylation (SSP) and S-glutathionylation (SGT) in vivo. SSP is a post-translational modification of proteins that occurs in response to oxidative stress and changes the activity of proteins by converting thiols to sulfenylated cysteines \[[@B67-ijms-19-02208]\]. SGT is a type of protein S-glutathionylation (GS-SG) that is catalyzed by glutaredoxin and glutathione-S-transferase \[[@B68-ijms-19-02208]\]. SSP and SGT are reversible, but not in protein glutathionylation. However, both SSP and SGT are regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and are associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases \[[@

Prompt:  S5327 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5327 is a drug that targets p53 and Rb in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. We demonstrated that treatment with MSC-S5327 causes a dose-dependent increase in cell death and reduction of cell proliferation in both Rb and p53 mutant cell lines. The growth inhibition was accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. We showed that MSC-S5327 induced apoptosis through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. The latter is p53-independent, and involves the activation of p53, p38, and JNK pathways. In addition, MSC-S5327 induced autophagy in cancer cells. We also demonstrated that MSC-S5327 inhibited cell migration and invasion, two processes essential for cancer metastasis. MSC-S5327 is a novel compound that may be used in cancer treatment, and we anticipate that the discovery of novel drugs targeting cell cycle regulatory proteins will

Prompt:  S5333 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5333 is a drug that targets STAT3 and is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.^[@bib47]^ This study showed that A549 cells were more sensitive to STA-21 than H1299 cells, which was consistent with our results showing that A549 cells expressed higher levels of STAT3 than H1299 cells. As expected, STA-21 treatment reduced STAT3 expression and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, VEGF and Snail, which are STAT3 downstream targets, in A549 cells. These results suggest that STAT3 may be involved in mediating the resistance of A549 cells to paclitaxel and cisplatin.

As a potent and selective inhibitor of STAT3, STA-21 could be a promising drug for treating tumors that overexpress STAT3. STA-21 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model of hepato

Prompt:  S5341 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5341 is a drug that targets the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and the cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein (RB), which is a tumor suppressor protein. This phosphorylation releases the transcription factor E2F, which in turn leads to the transcription of E2F target genes such as CCND1 and CCNE1. The expression of CCND1 and CCNE1 results in the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase. As a result, the inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 leads to the suppression of tumor cell growth and induction of apoptosis.

S5341 inhibits tumor cell growth in human cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, and prostate cancer, in which the CCND1 and CCNE1 genes are

Response: S5343 is a drug that targets CD44v6. The anti-cancer effects of S5343 on CRC were first demonstrated in xenograft models and then in clinical trials. This drug also showed activity in sarcomas. However, phase II clinical trials for S5343 have not been initiated in HCC or CRC.

We also included in this study three additional agents that target cell surface receptors: anti-HER2 (trastuzumab), anti-HER3 (pertuzumab) and anti-EGFR (cetuximab). These agents are widely used in clinical practice. The results for trastuzumab are clear, with no survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC. Pertuzumab and cetuximab have also shown efficacy in advanced CRC. However, there is no clinical evidence of efficacy for these agents in HCC or CRC.

Prompt:  S5345 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5345 is a drug that targets HSP90 and has been developed for cancer treatment. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in various cancer cell lines and primary tumors^[@R6]^.

The key finding in this study is that HSP90 inhibitors exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in human macrophages. We found that HSP90 inhibitors suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-1β expression, which was mediated by inhibition of IKKβ phosphorylation. The inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1β expression was associated with reduced expression of the IL-6 and IL-1β mRNAs, reduced p65 and p50 nuclear translocation, and reduced phosphorylation of the p65 and p50 proteins.

In this study, we identified an HSP90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, as a potent inhibitor of inflammation in human macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of NVP-AUY

Prompt:  S5350 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5350 is a drug that targets the checkpoint kinase Chk1. Chk1 has a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and maintaining genome stability. Inhibition of Chk1 in cancer cells is being actively explored, with the aim of using it to selectively kill cancer cells without affecting normal cells. However, the most studied inhibitor of Chk1, PF477736, has shown disappointing activity in cancer patients and Chk1 inhibition may cause cell cycle arrest and genomic instability, which could contribute to tumour recurrence.

We report here that the new Chk1 inhibitor S5350 induces rapid and irreversible growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, S5350 causes rapid and complete tumour regression in vivo in mice bearing a variety of human xenografts, without obvious toxicity. In addition, S5350 inhibits the growth of human tumours in nude mice in which no effective treatment has been shown to date

Prompt:  S5353 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5353 is a drug that targets the proteasome and has been used in the clinic to treat a number of cancers. In particular, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is highly active in many cancer types and inactivating this pathway can lead to tumor cell death [@B58]. Therefore, the BECN1/proteasome pathway is a promising target for cancer treatment. The BECN1 inhibitor, BECN1-I, has been shown to induce cancer cell death *in vitro* and *in vivo* [@B59]. BECN1-I induces cancer cell death through autophagy-mediated apoptosis [@B60], and this process is thought to be involved in the synergistic effects of BECN1-I and other drugs, such as crizotinib and gemcitabine [@B61], [@B62].

It has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited due to the systemic toxicities. In this study, we prepared a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting OX40 with a cleavable linker. This conjugate exhibited a high antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that this ADC effectively triggered apoptosis of tumor cells by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction.

Prompt:  S5357 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5357 is a drug that targets the DNA damage checkpoint in S phase. In the absence of an S phase checkpoint, the replication fork is a potential site of replication-induced DNA damage. For this reason, the lack of a robust checkpoint is likely to lead to an increase in the level of spontaneous DNA damage. In our hands, the level of spontaneous DNA damage in the absence of MMS was significantly higher in the Δ*rfa1* mutant than in the wild-type strain ([Figure 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}B). In contrast, we did not observe any significant difference in the level of spontaneous DNA damage between the wild-type and the Δ*rfa1* mutant in the presence of MMS. The latter result is consistent with a recent study in which MMS was used to induce DNA damage in the absence of an S phase checkpoint ([@B31]).

Prompt:  S5360 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5360 is a drug that targets a cellular protein called Nrf2 and suppresses its ability to induce expression of genes that protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that activates genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. Mice treated with S5360 show protection against acute lung injury, as well as neurodegeneration and cancer. S5360 has completed phase 1 and phase 2 trials in healthy volunteers and patients with renal disease.

Because Nrf2 is known to protect the kidney against ischemia-reperfusion injury, we tested whether S5360 could protect mice from acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion (IR). A mouse model of IR was created by clamping the left renal artery for 30 min followed by 24 hr of reperfusion. S5360 or vehicle was administered before clamping.

Prompt:  S5361 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5361 is a drug that targets Ras-MAPK signaling. NSC-S5361 is being developed by Novartis, and it has shown potent activity in mouse models of lung and skin cancer. However, in vitro studies have shown that NSC-S5361 induces aneuploidy and apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, a key question is whether NSC-S5361 has a clinical benefit in lung cancer patients. To investigate this question, we studied the effects of NSC-S5361 in primary cultures of human lung cancer cells. Our data indicate that NSC-S5361 induces G2-M arrest and apoptosis in primary lung cancer cells. In addition, NSC-S5361 significantly reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of human lung cancer. Together, these data indicate that NSC-S5361 is a potent drug that can be used in combination with other anticancer therapies to treat lung cancer patients.

Response: S5363 is a drug that targets both the eIF4E and eIF4G proteins, preventing them from forming the eIF4F complex ([@B84]). It has shown to be a promising compound against various cancers including breast cancer ([@B185]; [@B175]; [@B58]). In combination with conventional chemotherapeutics, S5363 could synergistically inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, including the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 ([@B64]). In the same study, the authors demonstrated that this drug could also suppress tumor growth in mice xenograft models. However, the drug also demonstrated to be effective against non-tumorigenic cells and tissues. Therefore, S5363 has to be carefully evaluated before its therapeutic use.

Our initial efforts focused on the optimization of the scaffold of the published AURKB inhibitor (7) by generating a series of C-8-substituted analogues. Compound 4 exhibited submicromolar potency against AURKB, and good selectivity over other kinases, including Aurora A, B, C, and CHK1. Further optimization of the central core structure yielded compound 5, which exhibited an improved potency against AURKB (IC50 = 9 nM), as well as a strong selectivity over AURKA, AURKC, and CHK1. The most potent compound 5 also showed strong antitumor activity in cell-based assays.

Prompt:  S5369 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5369 is a drug that targets the protein neddylation pathway, thereby inhibiting the neddylation of Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs)^[@R12]^. Although the exact role of neddylation in cancer is unclear, neddylation of CRLs has been shown to promote degradation of cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors^[@R13]^. Here, we report that S5369 treatment increases expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, and sensitizes GBM cells to radiation and temozolomide. In GBM cells, we observed an increase in neddylation after S5369 treatment, suggesting that this compound may be acting through the neddylation pathway. We found that the combination of S5369 and radiation was more effective than either agent alone in GBM cell lines. The combination of S5369 and temozolomide

Response: S5371 is a drug that targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)^[@R21]^. *In vitro* and *in vivo* studies in the past decade have shown that inhibition of mPTP suppresses TNF-α-induced inflammation, neuronal damage, and delayed neuronal death^[@R1]--[@R3]^. In the current study, we have used an established model of TNF-α-induced brain inflammation in rats and demonstrate that RIPK1 inhibition with the clinically approved drug S5371 attenuates TNF-α-induced brain inflammation. Our results indicate that this protective effect is mediated by inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity and apoptosis.

S5371 was administered intravenously to TNF-α-treated rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The compound has a long terminal half-life of 2--3 days,

Response: S5372 is a drug that targets IL-6R, a cytokine that has been implicated in multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ([@bib13]; [@bib15]; [@bib26]; [@bib23]; [@bib19]; [@bib21]; [@bib30]). However, the clinical utility of S5372 has been limited by its in vivo instability and suboptimal pharmacokinetics ([@bib14]). We sought to overcome these challenges by creating a PEGylated and bioconjugated S5372 derivative.

We first synthesized a PEGylated derivative of S5372, which we called PEG-S5372, by conjugating PEG (molecular weight 5 kDa) to the C-terminal carboxyl group of S5372. We then evaluated the ability of PEG-S5

Prompt:  S5378 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5378 is a drug that targets a small population of normal stem cells that are already dividing. Therefore, S5378 causes a population-wide loss of HSCs.

Another new therapy being developed for AML is a gene therapy called CAR-T-cells. These cells are genetically modified to express a receptor on their surface that recognizes a specific antigen. The goal of this therapy is to redirect the T cells to kill the leukemia cells that are infected with the virus, so that they can’t proliferate. In contrast, CD19-CAR-T-cells that are being developed for B-cell leukemia and lymphoma are genetically modified to recognize the CD19 antigen on B-cells. This therapy has been shown to be effective in some cases of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma, and a Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted for the treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Prompt:  S5382 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5382 is a drug that targets the bcl-2 family and Bcl-xl. It induces apoptosis in AML cells via Bcl-xl-dependent and -independent pathways. In vitro, S5382 induces apoptosis in primary AML cells, but not in normal bone marrow progenitors. In vivo, S5382 is well tolerated and induces complete remission in mice engrafted with primary human AML cells. S5382 induces apoptosis in AML cells by inhibiting Bcl-xl and by stimulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. S5382 is currently in phase I/II clinical trials in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The Bcl-2 protein family is composed of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. The Bcl-2 protein family regulates the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Bcl-xl is a proto-oncogene that is upregulated

Response: S5384 is a drug that targets the insulin receptor and is in clinical trials for type 2 diabetes. Although its effect on cell-surface levels of insulin receptors is small, it inhibits the phosphorylation of the receptor at tyrosine residues. S5384 blocks insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 in cells, as well as the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, including Shc, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase C-γ. In addition, S5384 inhibits the insulin-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, including the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).

Prompt:  S5389 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5389 is a drug that targets the MAPK signaling pathway, which is a key signaling pathway that regulates cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation ([@b39-ijmm-40-06-1657]). Inhibition of the MAPK pathway is considered to be a promising treatment for cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of ETS-related transcription factor (ERTF) inhibitors have not been previously reported. In the present study, we found that the knockdown of ERTFs using siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Moreover, our results revealed that the ERTF inhibitor ETS5389 significantly reduced the expression of ERTFs, inhibited the activation of the MAPK pathway, and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. The ERTF inhibitor ETS5389 is a potential anticancer drug for the treatment of HCC.

Response: S5395 is a drug that targets the second messenger cyclic AMP and is currently used to treat hyperactivity in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the molecular mechanism by which S5395 exerts its effects on the dopamine system remains unclear. Here, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify a novel protein-protein interaction between S5395 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1). In vitro kinase assay confirmed the direct binding of GIT1 to S5395. We also showed that GIT1 inhibited the interaction between dopamine D2 receptor and G protein βγ subunit. GIT1 overexpression impaired the inhibitory effects of dopamine on cAMP production in SH-SY5Y cells, and GIT1 knockdown enhanced the inhibition of cAMP production by dopamine. Furthermore, GIT1 inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase

Prompt:  S5397 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5397 is a drug that targets protein kinase C. Previous work has shown that the drug has an effect on the P2X7 receptor. It is known to have a more potent effect on P2X7 than on P2X4. Therefore, it is likely that this compound is acting on the P2X7 receptor. The data indicate that the P2X7 receptor is present on the cell membrane of endothelial cells. However, there was no effect of the compound on the intracellular Ca^2+^ concentration. The results suggest that this compound may be a P2X7 receptor antagonist.

Prompt:  S5398 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5398 is a drug that targets ribosome biogenesis and is under clinical development for treatment of hematologic malignancies. To date, the clinical development of this drug has been hindered by the identification of mutations in ribosomal proteins that cause resistance to this agent. To study the mechanism of resistance to S5398, we screened S5398-resistant cell lines for mutations in genes that are involved in ribosome biogenesis and compared the phenotype of the cell lines to that of the parental cell lines. We found that resistance to S5398 was associated with acquired mutations in the genes encoding ribosomal proteins L13a, S19, S27a, and S3a. Interestingly, some of these mutations were also found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and one of the mutations (S27a) was also found in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Prompt:  S5408 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5408 is a drug that targets the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme and has been studied in the treatment of several types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. Our studies demonstrated that the compound can be rapidly converted to S5409 and S5410, which are the active compounds. A drug that converts to multiple active compounds is known as a prodrug. To reduce the possibility of a poor response, it is important to minimize the conversion of the prodrug to the active compounds. We examined the chemical stability of S5408 in the presence of human liver microsomes and in rat and human plasma. We found that the half-life of S5408 in rat and human plasma was 8.2 and 13.5 h, respectively. The half-life of S5408 in human liver microsomes was approximately 7.5 h.

Prompt:  S5410 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5410 is a drug that targets telomerase, which is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that elongates telomeres, and can be upregulated in cancer cells. Telomerase-targeted therapy may be effective in the treatment of human cancers, but it has also been associated with some toxicities such as myelosuppression and pulmonary fibrosis, and is not effective in all tumor types. There are several ongoing clinical trials testing different telomerase inhibitors, but most of these studies are evaluating the efficacy of the drug in patients with advanced cancers. The effects of the drug on tumor cells that have not undergone a telomerase-driven immortalization process have not been studied in depth. The role of telomerase and its regulation in cells that are not immortalized is not known.

To address this question, we tested the effects of the telomerase inhibitor S5410 on a variety of cancer cell lines that are derived from different organs and tissues.

Response: S5419 is a drug that targets both P-gp and the hERG K^+^ channel. In the present study, it was shown that this drug can affect both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant human breast cancer cells. Our study indicates that S5419 may be a useful therapeutic agent to target both P-gp and hERG K^+^ channels.

The data from the present study demonstrated that S5419 can increase the accumulation of both doxorubicin and daunorubicin in MDR cells, which was a consequence of increased drug uptake. S5419 also significantly decreased the efflux of doxorubicin and daunorubicin in MDR cells. The IC~50~ values of doxorubicin and daunorubicin were decreased from 8.47 and 6.66 µM in MDR cells to 2.38 and 1.95 µM, respectively, after

Prompt:  S5428 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5428 is a drug that targets the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), which is found in the mitochondria of the brain and other tissues. It is used to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

This article focuses on the metabolism of S-5428.

Metabolism

Metabolism of S-5428 occurs mainly in the liver and kidneys. The primary metabolic pathway is glucuronidation, followed by N-deacetylation, N-oxidation, and N-dealkylation.

Approved Uses

S-5428 is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ALS.

Treatment of ALS

The recommended dosage of S-5428 is 40 mg orally, once a day.

Response: S5430 is a drug that targets the survival and proliferation of a small sub-population of cancer cells with the potential to drive tumor progression.

As previously reported, the Src family kinase Fyn is one of the key molecules involved in the crosstalk between the Hh and Wnt signaling pathways \[[@R23]\]. In the present study, we found that the inhibition of Fyn by S5430 led to the suppression of Wnt signaling by the suppression of Wnt5a expression. It is known that Wnt5a is a ligand of the Wnt receptor Frizzled, which is expressed in breast cancer cells \[[@R24]\]. In addition, the Frizzled family of receptors, which is a sub-family of seven transmembrane domain proteins, has been reported to be associated with breast cancer development \[[@R25]\].

Prompt:  S5435 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5435 is a drug that targets the ribosome, an essential component of the protein synthesis machinery, to inhibit protein synthesis.^[@ref40]^ As shown in Figure [3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}C, the Cys-containing proteins are more sensitive to ribosome inhibition than their non-Cys-containing counterparts, indicating that Cys-containing proteins are more sensitive to the ribosome inhibition. The small number of proteins that are known to contain Cys in their sequences is insufficient to explain this phenomenon, suggesting that the cysteine-rich proteins may be more sensitive to ribosome inhibition because of their involvement in cellular processes that are critical for cell survival.

This is the first report that identifies Cys-containing proteins in a *C. elegans* proteome, and the discovery of the widespread distribution of Cys-containing proteins in the proteome is an important step toward the development of novel therapies

Response: S5447 is a drug that targets the STAT3 protein and inhibits its activation and its dimerization. This leads to the inhibition of the STAT3-mediated transactivation of various genes and ultimately inhibits cell growth.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the S3I-201 treatment is effective in preclinical studies, such as inhibiting growth of human prostate cancer cells ([@b40-ol-0-0-11550]). However, the side effects of S3I-201 treatment remain a problem. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a new drug that is more effective and with fewer side effects.

Response: S5450 is a drug that targets EGFR in the brain and, like Erlotinib, is currently in Phase II clinical trials.^[@ref39]^ The identification of S5450 as a potent inhibitor of mutant EGFR is a valuable contribution to our understanding of EGFR inhibition.

Conclusions {#sec3}
===========

We have identified a new class of small molecule inhibitors that bind to EGFR TK domain and have an unprecedented mechanism of action. The combination of the nanomolar potency, the unique binding mode, and the cell permeability that we have observed in cellular assays, and the potent in vivo efficacy we have demonstrated in two animal models, suggests that this new class of EGFR inhibitors may have significant therapeutic potential.

Prompt:  S5454 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5454 is a drug that targets an integral membrane protein. It is a novel anticancer agent that causes cell death by binding to and inhibiting its target, the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) (1,2).

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease (3). Despite significant advances in cancer treatment, a cure is not available. A significant number of patients die from the complications of cancer and cancer treatment, and the development of effective anticancer drugs is a major unmet medical need.

Although many anticancer drugs are cytotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells, the goal of cancer therapy is to minimize toxicity and improve quality of life for the patient. A novel approach is to target a protein expressed by a cancer cell and not by normal cells. This approach would be especially beneficial in targeting cells that are responsible for cancer recurrence and metastasis. The M1 m

Response: S5457 is a drug that targets the glucocorticoid receptor. Glucocorticoids have an important role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. In hypercalcemic states, parathyroid hormone (PTH) can cause rapid increases in serum calcium levels. In some patients, this response is exaggerated, causing rapid release of calcium from bone, and in turn, hypocalcemia. The role of PTH and calcium homeostasis in the pathogenesis of fibrositis has not been established. The authors evaluated the effect of S5457 on calcium homeostasis and the ability of S5457 to inhibit PTH-stimulated calcium release from bone in a rat model of fibrositis.

Prompt:  S5473 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5473 is a drug that targets a specific tyrosine kinase receptor in cancer cells. The anticancer effect of this drug was first discovered in myeloid cells in 1991 [@B34]. Since then, many clinical trials have been conducted on various types of cancer, and the results have been promising. However, due to the side effects and the development of resistance, clinical applications have been limited. One possible reason is that the pharmacokinetic profiles of S5473 were not optimized, resulting in a high concentration of S5473 in the liver and a low concentration in the tumor. To overcome this problem, a number of drug delivery systems have been developed for the delivery of S5473, such as nanoparticles [@B35], liposomes [@B36], and polymeric nanoparticles [@B37]. In particular, polymeric nanoparticles have received increasing attention as a promising drug delivery system due to their good biocompatibility and ability to achieve sustained

Prompt:  S5477 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5477 is a drug that targets the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. HMG-CoA reductase is the first enzyme in the mevalonate pathway and catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This reaction is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is thus a target for cholesterol-lowering drugs. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins leads to reduced production of mevalonate, which results in reduced cholesterol biosynthesis and, consequently, reduced levels of intracellular cholesterol. In addition to its role in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase also catalyzes the formation of several isoprenoids that are required for cellular processes such as regulation of gene expression, cell growth and cell division, and protein prenylation (e.g., Ras and Rap1A) (Tamaoki et al., [@B

Prompt:  S5480 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5480 is a drug that targets the cysteine protease Cathepsin L. This enzyme is involved in a number of physiological processes including antigen processing, T-cell activation, and apoptosis. CTSL activity is also required for the maturation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHC-II) in antigen presenting cells. Therefore, the S5480 compound has been suggested as a potential immunosuppressant for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
CTSL is also expressed by a number of tumour cells and CTSL inhibitors may be useful as anticancer agents. For example, CTSL inhibitors may induce apoptosis in tumour cells by inducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of ER stress.

Response: S5484 is a drug that targets multiple processes that are characteristic of PD, such as dopamine synthesis, dopamine uptake, dopamine receptor binding, and oxidative stress. As it has been reported that SZ and PD have similar pathological mechanisms ([@B12]; [@B13]), the same drug was used to treat patients with PD.

As shown in [**Figure 3**](#f3){ref-type="fig"}, the levodopa/carbidopa therapy was significantly improved after 1 month of treatment. However, SZ continued to progress, and one patient required a switch to another antipsychotic medication after 6 months of treatment. Another patient was switched to the same antipsychotic medication because of the inefficacy of SZ treatment. The dosage of SZ was increased in the two patients after 3 months of treatment, and the clinical symptoms were significantly improved. However, the symptoms were relapsed after 6 months of treatment.

Prompt:  S5485 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5485 is a drug that targets the expression of α-synuclein. The mutant A53T α-synuclein, which causes familial PD, is known to be more stable than the wild-type protein. The interaction between α-synuclein and Hsp90 stabilizes the mutant protein, which may be a possible mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation in PD^[@CR47]^. Therefore, Hsp90 inhibitors might be useful in PD treatment.

NSC23766 is a small molecule that inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp90. In this study, we found that NSC23766 increased the ubiquitination of α-synuclein, but did not increase its level. This may be due to the fact that the mutant A53T α-synuclein was stabilized by Hsp90. Moreover, the interaction between α-synuclein and Hsp90 is crucial for its aggregation. NSC23766

Prompt:  S5486 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5486 is a drug that targets ERα and is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of breast cancer and in other cancers such as lung cancer. While the effect of S5486 on ERα is similar to that of fulvestrant, the drug is approximately ten times more potent than fulvestrant at reducing proliferation of cells expressing ERα. Importantly, unlike fulvestrant, S5486 does not appear to promote the growth of cells expressing an ERα splice variant lacking the ligand binding domain (LBD). These data suggest that S5486 is a better choice for treatment of ERα-positive breast cancers that are unresponsive to current therapies.

Prompt:  S5492 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5492 is a drug that targets cancer cells through two distinct mechanisms: it induces cell cycle arrest in G1/S and G2/M phases through a mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint and causes apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, S5492 has been shown to cause the rapid degradation of the DNA damage repair protein 53BP1, a tumor suppressor protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest.^[@ref14],[@ref15]^ This dual mode of action may contribute to the ability of S5492 to overcome chemo- and radiotherapy resistance in cancer cells.

The protein--protein interaction (PPI) network of S5492 in the human proteome is depicted in Figure [2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}. The figure shows the PPI network of S5492 in the human proteome, which consists of 438 nodes and 12 708 edges. As shown in Figure

Prompt:  S5493 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5493 is a drug that targets the VEGFR2 receptor and is used to treat advanced colorectal cancer and advanced renal cell carcinoma. A recent study in colon cancer cell lines suggested that VEGFR2 inhibition by Axitinib increases apoptosis through the activation of p53^[@CR23]^. However, the role of p53 in the regulation of autophagy in cancer cells remains controversial. In this study, we found that silencing of *TP53* by siRNA resulted in a decrease in the level of p53 and p-p53^Ser15^, and inhibition of autophagy by CQ could reverse the effect of *TP53* silencing on the viability of HCT116 cells. In contrast, the ectopic expression of p53^S15A^ mutant, which has reduced binding to p53^Ser15^, inhibited the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and decreased the

Prompt:  S5494 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5494 is a drug that targets one of the mechanisms of resistance to MAPKi, by reducing levels of Cbl and thereby enhancing the effects of MAPKi.

MPM samples from which *NRAS* mutations were identified in our analysis were derived from a cohort of patients with untreated advanced melanoma. Although the primary clinical outcome was OS, we also assessed the effect of MK2206 and S5494 on progression-free survival (PFS) and found that the MK2206/S5494 combination had a significant benefit in PFS. The median PFS was 8.6 months for MK2206 monotherapy, 5.5 months for S5494 monotherapy, and 10.2 months for the combination of MK2206 and S5494. In contrast to OS, the benefit of the combination was not observed in patients with BRAF^V600E^-mutated melanoma. This may be due to the lack of effect of MK220

Prompt:  S5496 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5496 is a drug that targets PARP-1, a protein involved in the DNA repair pathway and which has been found to be over-expressed in many cancers. The effect of the compound was assessed in cell-based assays for PARP-1 inhibition. The compound was shown to bind PARP-1 in vitro with an IC~50~ of 5 μM. It was then assessed for efficacy in a number of cell-based assays. In HCT116 cells the compound showed anti-proliferative effects at 10 μM, an effect which was abolished by PARP-1 knockdown. The compound was then assessed for its ability to cause DSBs in HCT116 cells, by exposing cells to DNA-damaging agents (etoposide, camptothecin and doxorubicin) in the presence or absence of the compound. The results showed that the compound caused DNA damage at 10 μM, an effect which

Prompt:  S5497 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5497 is a drug that targets the cathepsin S (CTSS) and cathepsin L (CTSL) enzymes, which have a key role in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption^[@CR44]^. *In vitro* assays with mouse osteoclasts and *ex vivo* analyses of the mouse skeleton revealed that S5497 treatment decreased the number of osteoclasts, inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and increased bone mineral density^[@CR45]^. Therefore, CTSS and CTSL are promising targets for the treatment of bone-related diseases.

Response: S5499 is a drug that targets Src tyrosine kinase and blocks the function of EGFR-ErbB1-2-3 receptor complexes in breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of S5499 in combination with doxorubicin in a mouse model of human breast cancer. Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of female SCID mice and the tumors were allowed to develop for 10 days. The mice were randomized to one of four treatment groups: control (PBS), doxorubicin (5 mg/kg), S5499 (25 mg/kg) and combination (doxorubicin + S5499).

Prompt:  S5500 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5500 is a drug that targets the dopamine transporter (DAT) and causes dopamine to accumulate in the synaptic cleft. However, it also blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT) and results in the accumulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the synaptic cleft.[@b21-ndt-14-2205] In addition, S5500 increases extracellular dopamine by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic neurons.

Prompt:  S5504 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5504 is a drug that targets the SREBPs, which are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. The SREBPs are a family of structurally related proteins that regulate lipid metabolism and are responsible for the expression of many genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. Specifically, SREBP-1c is a protein that regulates the expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes. SREBP-1c contains an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide, a DNA-binding domain, and a nuclear localization signal. SREBP-1c is retained in the cytoplasm and is inactive. When cholesterol levels in the cell increase, SREBP-1c is cleaved by proteases and translocates to the nucleus. SREBP-1c then binds to a specific sequence in the promoter region of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and induces their expression.

Prompt:  S5505 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5505 is a drug that targets the endothelin receptors (ET~A~ and ET~B~) \[[@B1]\]. ET~A~ and ET~B~ are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are known to be expressed in the heart \[[@B2]\]. The actions of ET-1 are known to be mediated by the ET~A~ receptor, and blockade of this receptor is believed to have a beneficial effect in the treatment of cardiac diseases \[[@B3]\]. ET~B~ receptors are known to have a negative inotropic effect in the heart \[[@B4]\].

Prompt:  S5506 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5506 is a drug that targets FANCD2, an enzyme that is involved in DNA repair, and is therefore a potential cancer therapy. In this study, we show that S5506 kills multiple myeloma (MM) cells in vitro and in vivo. S5506 treatment inhibited the growth of MM cells, increased apoptosis, induced the formation of DNA breaks, and activated caspase-3. The mechanism of action of S5506 in MM cells involved the downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and BCLXL and the upregulation of the proapoptotic proteins BAX and PUMA. In vivo, S5506 significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of MM mice. Our data show that S5506 can be a potential therapy for MM.

Prompt:  S5508 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5508 is a drug that targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. S5508 acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of anastomosis between epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor. S5508 induces apoptosis in human cancer cells with overexpression of EGF receptors and is currently in phase II clinical trials for metastatic cancers. Here, we show that S5508 induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines, including those with acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs, but not in normal human cells. We demonstrate that S5508 induces ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. UPR is triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, and the UPR then activates three signaling pathways, namely inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK

Prompt:  S5514 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5514 is a drug that targets the Wnt signaling pathway, and is therefore expected to show a strong inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration.

To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of S5514 was associated with apoptosis, we analyzed the sub-G1 population of the cells by flow cytometry. We observed a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is an indicator of apoptosis (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}B).

Prompt:  S5515 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5515 is a drug that targets the VPS34-Beclin-1 complex. Treatment of HCT116 cells with VPS34-S5515 leads to accumulation of the autophagosome marker LC3-II. The accumulation of LC3-II in the presence of VPS34-S5515 indicates that the drug blocks the formation of autophagosomes, consistent with a role for the complex in autophagosome formation. To confirm this, we treated cells with the drug in the presence of bafilomycin A1, which blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Under these conditions, we found that the LC3-II level was further increased in the presence of VPS34-S5515, indicating that the drug prevents the degradation of autophagosomes.

Prompt:  S5528 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5528 is a drug that targets the sigma receptor. It was discovered by academic drug discovery programs and entered Phase II trials in the late 1980s. It is being developed by Invega (now part of Cephalon), which obtained a U.S. patent for S5528 in 1996 and has since filed for additional patents. The Phase II trials were terminated in 1999 due to insufficient efficacy and a lack of safety data. The company has never released a clinical development plan for the drug. It is believed to have been sold in the U.S. in 2000. Invega has never filed an NDA for S5528 and has only had two applications for patents on the compound, including one for an unrelated use. Invega also has a new drug in Phase II trials called AR-R11572.

Prompt:  S5530 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5530 is a drug that targets Cdc42, a small GTPase that has been implicated in the formation of filopodia, membrane ruffles, and the formation of stress fibers ([@B20]). Our finding that pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 with S5530 causes a redistribution of focal adhesions in these cells to a pattern that is similar to that seen in the presence of constitutively active Cdc42 is consistent with a role for Cdc42 in the formation of focal adhesions. This is consistent with a study showing that siRNA-mediated silencing of Cdc42 decreases focal adhesion size in endothelial cells ([@B33]). We also found that inhibition of Cdc42 with S5530 leads to a reduction in the number of focal adhesions per cell. This is in contrast to the findings of [@B33], who found that silencing of Cdc42 in endothelial cells increases the number of focal

Prompt:  S5533 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5533 is a drug that targets telomerase in vivo, which has been approved by the FDA for treating telomerase-positive cancers. This drug induces apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibiting the telomerase catalytic activity, and it is generally well-tolerated by patients, with a manageable safety profile.[@CIT0025] However, the clinical efficacy of telomerase inhibitors is unsatisfactory. One of the possible reasons is that telomerase is expressed in normal cells, which may lead to drug resistance. In this study, we observed that hNPCs were more sensitive to telomerase inhibitor S5533 than their differentiated counterparts, which indicated that telomerase inhibitors may be more effective for tumor-specific therapy. However, this is only a preliminary study and further in vivo experiments are needed to confirm this.

In summary, we found that the expression of telomerase in hNPCs was higher than that in their differentiated counterparts

Prompt:  S5535 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5535 is a drug that targets VEGF-A. Bevacizumab is an antibody that inhibits VEGF-A, a cytokine that promotes the growth of blood vessels. This is the only FDA-approved targeted therapy for RCC. This drug has been shown to improve PFS when combined with interferon. In contrast, sunitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of VEGF receptors, PDGF receptors, and c-kit. It is also approved for the treatment of RCC. As expected, it has activity against RCC, and can be used alone or in combination with IFN or bevacizumab. Sunitinib is currently the standard of care for patients with metastatic RCC who have been previously treated with IFN. The use of this drug is not associated with any increased risk of thrombosis.

Prompt:  S5544 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5544 is a drug that targets the IKK complex. It was developed to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation, and therefore was considered a potential therapeutic for inflammatory diseases such as RA.^[@R1],[@R2]^ While S5544 was effective in a preclinical model of RA, it had minimal efficacy in clinical trials.^[@R3]^ Subsequent studies showed that S5544 inhibited the degradation of IκBα and NF-κB activity in RA synovial fibroblasts,^[@R4]^ but it also reduced the survival of synovial fibroblasts by inducing apoptosis.^[@R5]^

S5544 was the first compound to inhibit both the IKK complex and the TRAF6 E3 ligase, a result that has now been extended to other compounds that target the IKK complex,^[@R6]^ suggesting that this

Prompt:  S5545 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5545 is a drug that targets the apoptosis pathway. The inhibition of apoptosis leads to a decrease in the number of cancer cells, and, thus, a reduction in tumor size \[[@B26-ijms-18-01991]\]. In our experiment, the inhibitory effect of S5545 on the proliferation of colon cancer cells was assessed. Our results showed that S5545 treatment significantly decreased the proliferation of HCT116 and SW620 cells, as evidenced by the colony formation assay. Furthermore, S5545-induced apoptosis was observed in HCT116 and SW620 cells by flow cytometry analysis. These results indicate that S5545 has an inhibitory effect on colon cancer cell proliferation.

A previous study showed that S5545 significantly inhibited the proliferation of various tumor cell lines \[[@B27-ijms-18-01991]\]. In our study, the results of a proliferation assay indicated that S5545

Prompt:  S5547 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5547 is a drug that targets MDR-1 (P-gp), the main mechanism of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells. The results of our study demonstrated that S5547 was able to inhibit the proliferation of multidrug-resistant MCF-7/MDR cells in a dose-dependent manner and was able to increase the accumulation of Rh123 in the MCF-7/MDR cells. Additionally, it was found that the IC~50~ values of S5547 in MCF-7/MDR cells were significantly lower than those in MCF-7 cells. In addition, S5547 was able to significantly increase the accumulation of Rh123 in MCF-7/MDR cells and inhibit the activity of P-gp. These results demonstrated that S5547 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7/MDR cells and can significantly increase the accumulation of Rh123 in MCF-7/MDR cells.

Prompt:  S5558 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5558 is a drug that targets both the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Treatment of melanoma cells with S5558 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that S5558 suppresses melanoma tumor growth. The combination of S5558 and dabrafenib was synergistic in vivo. The combination of S5558 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 was synergistic in vitro. In vivo, the combination of S5558 and BEZ235 resulted in synergistic tumor growth inhibition. These results suggest that S5558 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 may be effective in the treatment of melanoma.

Prompt:  S5560 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5560 is a drug that targets the p53 pathway. It can induce apoptosis in human cancer cells with p53 mutations. A phase II clinical trial for patients with breast cancer is currently underway. This drug is known to induce a strong p53-dependent response in normal fibroblasts and was thus considered for use in the clinic. However, as S5560 can induce a G1/S checkpoint arrest in normal fibroblasts, it is also associated with toxicities.

The compound KPT-185 was originally developed by Suntory. It is a highly potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor that blocks cell cycle progression at the G1/S checkpoint. It also inhibits other CDKs, including CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, and CDK9. It has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in a panel of human cancer cell lines.

Response: S5562 is a drug that targets an oncogenic pathway that has been validated in a Phase II clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we determined the expression of S5562 in GBMs using an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset of 110 GBM specimens. We observed that approximately one-third of GBMs exhibited high levels of S5562 expression. The high S5562-expressing GBMs had a significantly worse prognosis than GBMs with low S5562 expression. In addition, the GBMs with high S5562 expression had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than those with low S5562 expression. In a series of in vitro studies, S5562 suppressed the proliferation and migration of GBMs. Furthermore, a high level of S5562 expression was associated with shorter OS and PFS in the treatment-naïve GBMs and GBM

Prompt:  S5566 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5566 is a drug that targets the sodium pump. It’s a common mechanism used by many chemotherapy drugs. In fact, the sodium pump is so important to the function of cancer cells that it’s considered an “Achilles’ heel” for cancer cells.

In some cancers, cancer cells have lost the ability to utilize sodium. This loss of sodium-dependent action potentials allows the cancer cells to more easily proliferate.

Cancer cells that do not have this sodium pump have a different growth pattern and are more likely to die.

This has led to an increased interest in using S5566 to kill cancer cells.

The research that we’re talking about today, was published in Cancer Cell in 2014.

Sodium pumps are made up of two parts: a “pump” that moves sodium into the cell and an “exchanger” that moves sodium out of the

Prompt:  S5568 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5568 is a drug that targets the UGT1A1 enzyme, which is responsible for the catabolism of bilirubin and other drugs in the body. It works by inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme, preventing the breakdown of drugs in the body. This means that the drugs in the body are no longer broken down, which can result in increased toxicity. This toxicity can cause severe side effects and even death. Sulfasalazine is a drug that is often used in conjunction with sulfapyridine in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine works by increasing the production of a protein that aids in the absorption of sulfapyridine, which in turn helps to increase the effectiveness of the drug. The use of Sulfasalazine is contraindicated in patients with hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, or increased bilirubin levels.

Response: S5569 is a drug that targets the RhoA signaling pathway in breast cancer. It is in phase II clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer and for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. It is currently being evaluated in combination with docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In preclinical studies, S5569 inhibits migration, invasion, and proliferation of cancer cells and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We show here that S5569 inhibits the migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells, which are characterized by low expression of E-cadherin and high expression of N-cadherin. The effect of S5569 on migration and invasion was dependent on the RhoA/ROCK pathway and E-cadherin.

Although the data regarding its mechanism of action are somewhat controversial, one model proposes that S5582 works through inhibiting GSK3 and that it does not directly inhibit the kinase activity of GSK3, as has been suggested for other GSK3 inhibitors. Rather, it is thought to be an allosteric inhibitor, displacing the GSK3β-substrate from the active site of the enzyme. This model is supported by the observation that S5582 has been shown to interact with the N-terminal lobe of GSK3β, which is required for substrate binding.

Response: S5585 is a drug that targets a different kinase from FMS and has been used in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The inhibition of GSK3 with TDZD-8 was found to cause inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Dai et al., Nat. Med. 2005, 11, 964-970). These results suggest that GSK3 inhibitors may have clinical potential as anti-cancer agents.
Although it has been established that GSK3 plays a role in cancer, the role of GSK3 in neurological disorders has been less well characterized. The development of therapeutics that can inhibit GSK3 activity is therefore an urgent need in the art to treat these neurological disorders.

Prompt:  S5588 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5588 is a drug that targets the ribosome and has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Here, we demonstrate that S5588 is also a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in multiple cell lines. In particular, S5588 potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, but not in non-dividing cells. The most striking difference between the antiviral effects of S5588 in primary cells and T cell lines was the marked increase in viral release in the latter. This difference could not be attributed to a difference in HIV-1 entry or integration or to a difference in the expression of CD4 and CXCR4, as all three were similar in primary cells and T cell lines. The difference was more likely to be due to an alteration in the post-integration steps of the viral life cycle. The findings presented here are the first

Response: S5592 is a drug that targets TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) and therefore has the potential to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is an IgG4 anti-TNF antibody, meaning it has a human IgG4 Fc portion. It has a low affinity for TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages. In these cells, S5592 is capable of triggering the apoptosis of these cells. The main purpose of the drug is to deplete monocytes and macrophages in the synovium and to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. S5592 also reduces the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts.

S5592 was developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and approved by the FDA in December 2011 for the treatment of active RA in adults. S5592

Prompt:  S5594 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5594 is a drug that targets the p53/p73/p63 axis. However, there are no published data regarding its effects in neuroblastoma. In this study, we demonstrate that S5594 significantly induces apoptosis in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines, with an EC~50~ ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 μM. This effect is associated with a strong induction of p73, but not of p53. Moreover, in cell lines with high expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, S5594 did not induce apoptosis, whereas in cell lines with low expression of Bcl-2, S5594 was able to induce apoptosis.

Our results show that S5594 induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines. S5594-induced apoptosis is p73-dependent and was significantly higher than that induced by the pan-p73 inhibitor Pifithrin-α, which

Prompt:  S5596 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5596 is a drug that targets the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) transporter. It is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma. ABCB1 is a cell membrane transporter that removes many anti-cancer drugs from cancer cells. ABCB1 transports many types of anti-cancer drugs, including vincristine, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, topotecan, and paclitaxel, from the cell. This is how the drug is targeted to cancer cells.

In the Phase II trial, patients were given a dose of S5596 (3 mg/kg/day) or placebo intravenously for 14 days, and the amount of drug in their blood was measured. The investigators found that the drug reduced the amount of drug in the blood of the patients who were given the drug.

Response: S5597 is a drug that targets the lipid metabolism. In addition to these approved drugs, some small molecules are being developed in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that in addition to the activity of the enzyme, other processes, such as activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 and activation of the HMG-CoA reductase, can be inhibited by statins. Thus, these studies demonstrate that statins may be useful in the treatment of cancer, in addition to their well-established role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This review will discuss the potential role of statins in the treatment of cancer.

Prompt:  S5598 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5598 is a drug that targets the extracellular domain of the cytokine receptor CD147. Its therapeutic value has been proven in clinical trials in which it was used to treat glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, and multiple myeloma. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of S5598 on cancer cells remains to be determined. In this study, we show that S5598 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. S5598 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, and CDK4 was significantly decreased in gastric cancer cells treated with S5598. S5598 also downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in gastric cancer cells. In addition, S5598

Prompt:  S5599 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5599 is a drug that targets VPS34, which in turn inhibits its catalytic activity and therefore the maturation of autophagosomes. VPS34 is a component of the class III PI3K complex and is involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which is the primary signaling molecule for autophagy. VPS34 is essential for the maturation of autophagosomes, and inhibiting its activity results in a block in the autophagy pathway. Thus, VPS34 inhibition is a strategy for inducing autophagy.

There are two different types of VPS34 inhibitors, including a peptide-based inhibitor (S2281) and a small-molecule inhibitor (S5599). S2281 was designed to inhibit the binding of VPS34 to the lipid-binding domain of the HOPS complex, whereas S5599 is a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks the

Response: S5601 is a drug that targets a cancer stem cell marker (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1, ALDH1A1).

In addition, to further confirm the inhibition of CSCs, the ALDH1A1 protein expression was examined. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of ALDH1A1 was downregulated in the EPI-S5601-treated group ([Fig. 3](#f3-ijo-54-05-1621){ref-type="fig"}).

Prompt:  S5614 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5614 is a drug that targets the Ras oncogene and is in development for the treatment of a variety of cancers. In addition to direct oncogenic Ras signaling, oncogenic Ras also upregulates transcription of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2. Here we report that S5614 downregulates BCL2 protein levels and induces apoptosis in human tumor cell lines that are dependent on oncogenic Ras signaling. In addition, we show that the S5614-induced apoptosis is enhanced by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. The antiapoptotic function of BCL2 is further enhanced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, indicating that the effect of S5614 on BCL2 levels and apoptosis is PI3K-dependent. Thus, S5614 may be useful in the treatment of cancers that are dependent on oncogenic Ras signaling.

Response: S5618 is a drug that targets angiogenesis in tumours. We demonstrate that Cis-S5618 (20 µM) reduces cell proliferation and clonogenicity in MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cell lines. Cis-S5618 induces cell death through a mechanism involving apoptosis, as shown by caspase 3 activation and by the appearance of a hypodiploid sub-G0/G1 population. In addition, Cis-S5618 induced an upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes such as bax and bak, and a downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL. Moreover, we demonstrate that Cis-S5618 induces a decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a downregulation of HIF-1α protein levels. Interestingly, Cis-S5618 significantly reduced tumour growth in xenograft models. These

Prompt:  S5620 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5620 is a drug that targets P-glycoprotein and inhibits its function.

In vitro
S5620 is metabolized to a carboxylic acid and a phenolic compound. The carboxylic acid is then hydrolyzed to form a phenolic acid. The phenolic acid is further metabolized to a quinone. The quinone is then oxidized to form a quinone imine.

S5620 inhibits the transport of digoxin by P-glycoprotein.

In vivo
S5620 is effective against cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) deficient CF mice. It does not affect the activity of wild-type CFTR, however.

Prompt:  S5623 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5623 is a drug that targets G-protein-coupled receptor 2 (GPR2) and is in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. GPR2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that has a distinct distribution in the brain and is known to regulate dopamine release. Recent evidence suggests that the regulation of dopamine release by GPR2 plays a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of S5623 on dopamine release in the brain and on motor function in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Administration of S5623 significantly increased dopamine release in the rat striatum. In addition, S5623 significantly improved motor function in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

Prompt:  S5625 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5625 is a drug that targets cancer stem cells and their niches and causes their apoptosis. S5625 is a lipophilic drug that easily crosses the cell membrane and can enter cancer stem cells. S5625 can inhibit the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a role in the development of cancer stem cells and their niches. The anti-cancer effect of S5625 is related to its ability to enter cancer stem cells and its inhibitory effect on the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, S5625 can also induce the apoptosis of cancer stem cells.

According to our results, the drug S5625 can inhibit the Notch signaling pathway and induce the apoptosis of cancer stem cells, which provides new ideas for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of the effect of S5625 remains unclear and needs further research.

Response: S5626 is a drug that targets the α-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and reduces the formation of Aβ \[[@CR20]\]. In our study, the GSK3β inhibitors and APP-GFP were co-transfected into HeLa cells, and Aβ was measured. The results indicated that, compared with APP-GFP alone, co-transfection of GSK3β inhibitor could increase the expression of Aβ. In addition, the secretion of Aβ was reduced after treatment with GSK3β inhibitors, which indicated that the α-secretase cleavage of APP was promoted by GSK3β inhibitors.

The phosphorylation of tau is an important step in the process of AD. To explore the effect of GSK3β inhibitors on the phosphorylation of tau, we measured the expression of tau and the phosphorylation of tau at different sites by western blotting

Prompt:  S5627 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5627 is a drug that targets the 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. It increases the level of cAMP in cells, and it activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in a cell-specific manner. This leads to phosphorylation of a number of downstream substrates that can alter their activities and/or protein--protein interactions, thus modulating downstream signaling events ([@bib29]). It also blocks the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) by MLC kinase (MLCK), thus preventing the contractile response of smooth muscle ([@bib23]). Because of its direct effect on smooth muscle contractility, S5627 has been proposed as a possible treatment for preterm labor.

In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with S5627 induces uterine quiescence by stimulating a large number of cell signaling pathways. Treatment of my

Response: S5629 is a drug that targets a specific member of the Rho family of small GTPases, ROCK1, and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials. In the present study, we investigated the effects of S5629 on human erythrocytes in vitro. S5629 was found to induce shape change and membrane aggregation in human erythrocytes. A decrease in the level of intracellular cAMP, phosphorylation of cofilin, and a reorganization of actin and spectrin cytoskeleton were observed after treatment with S5629. These data indicate that S5629 causes erythrocyte shape change and membrane aggregation through a cAMP-independent mechanism.

Response: S5630 is a drug that targets Rb1 in NSCLC and induces apoptosis. However, the drug does not inhibit pRb1 in melanoma cells. In contrast, Rb1 is inactivated in melanoma and it can be reactivated by a combination of small molecule inhibitors and an Rb1-specific antibody. This dual inhibition strategy induced apoptosis and resulted in significant tumor regression in vivo. We have developed a similar dual-inhibition strategy that is also active in melanoma.

Response: S5632 is a drug that targets and inhibits Src kinase activity. It is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumours. Src is one of the first proteins identified to be mutated in human cancer and it has been suggested that Src inhibition could be an effective strategy to treat Src-dependent cancers ([@bib21]).

Prompt:  S5648 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5648 is a drug that targets CDK1 and is effective against solid tumors such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and osteosarcoma ([@B53]). We have demonstrated that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated by PNUTS depletion in glioma cells. JNKs are involved in cellular stress responses and play important roles in cancer development ([@B13]). JNKs are activated by phosphorylation of their Thr-183 and Tyr-185 residues. Upon activation, JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun, which is a transcription factor of AP-1, at the Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues. Activated JNKs also phosphorylate the p53 at Ser-15, which induces p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, PNUTS may induce cell death through the activation of JNKs ([@B

Prompt:  S5650 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5650 is a drug that targets EGFR. The drug has already been used in clinical trials. The mechanism of action of this drug is still under investigation. However, it is known that the drug blocks cell proliferation by binding to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, which inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and prevents the autophosphorylation of EGFR. The drug can also cause the degradation of EGFR protein and deactivate EGFR signaling. Although S5650 has been found to be effective in the treatment of some cancers, it can also cause a variety of side effects, such as skin rashes, fever, nausea, and diarrhea. These side effects are caused by the inhibition of EGFR signaling.

Prompt:  S5653 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5653 is a drug that targets the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and has shown good safety and efficacy in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. It is a bifunctional molecule that binds both TNFR1 and TNFR2 and triggers apoptosis of activated T cells and cytokine release syndrome. We developed a biotinylated form of S5653 and showed that it was equally effective as the non-biotinylated form. S5653 is an example of a drug with very good safety and efficacy in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, but has a short half-life in humans. We have identified the peptidase dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) as a major clearance mechanism for S5653. However, it is not clear whether this is also true for other DPP-4 substrates, such as GLP-1, which is also cleared by DPP-4. We

Response: S5654 is a drug that targets the *B. anthracis* adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) with an IC~50~ of 3.5 nM ([@B8]). The *B. anthracis* F1F0-ATPase is composed of five subunits, A (A~1~), B (B~1~), C (C~1~), D (D~1~), and E (E~1~), that work in a sequential manner to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The active site of the *B. anthracis* F1F0-ATPase is comprised of the catalytic site and the nucleotide binding site. Bovine brain (BB) ATPase (A~1~B~1~C~1~D~1~E~1~) was used as a control for this study ([@

Response: S5655 is a drug that targets Hsp90 in cancer cells and is in phase II clinical trials for multiple myeloma. Hsp90 has a regulatory role in the maturation of some BCR signaling components, and therefore, we assessed the impact of Hsp90 inhibition on BCR signaling. CD79b was selected as a representative BCR signaling component because it is required for BCR signaling, and its maturation requires Hsp90 ([@bib33]; [@bib7]). The Hsp90 inhibitor had no effect on CD79b maturation, as measured by the abundance of CD79b in the B cell plasma membrane, but CD79b was mislocalized from the B cell plasma membrane to the cytosol after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors ([Fig. 3 A](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in CD79b phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 793 ([Fig

Prompt:  S5657 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5657 is a drug that targets mTORC1, the master regulator of protein synthesis in cancer cells. It is used to treat a range of cancers and its primary target is the mTORC1 complex. mTORC1 regulates translation and protein synthesis by controlling the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in the release of eIF4E, which in turn binds to the cap of mRNAs, enabling their translation. Phosphorylation of S6K results in the activation of S6K1, which phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6, stimulating translation.

In cancer cells, mTORC1 is hyperactive and as a result, S6K and 4E-BP1 are phosphorylated. As a result, the translation of many mRNAs is increased. The impact of S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphory

Prompt:  S5659 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5659 is a drug that targets PKC. As a matter of fact, the effect of PKC in apoptosis is controversial. In the presence of a pro-apoptotic stimulus, PKC activity is required for the activation of p53 and the release of cytochrome C, and for the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) ([@B74]; [@B24]; [@B62]). On the other hand, PKC has also been reported to promote apoptosis in the absence of a pro-apoptotic stimulus. In these cases, PKC promotes cell death by inducing apoptosis in response to an insult or a stressful stimulus, such as UV irradiation ([@B15]; [@B57]; [@B64]). Moreover, PKC activation is known to be associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest ([@B

Prompt:  S5660 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5660 is a drug that targets both Rho-GTPases and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Rho-GTPases are important for the regulation of cell morphology and motility, and EGFR is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. A first-in-class combination of the potent Rho-GTPase inhibitor SGI-1776 with the anti-EGFR drug erlotinib was recently shown to synergistically inhibit growth of a variety of human tumor xenografts \[[@CR56]\].

We have shown that this combination of SGI-1776 and erlotinib is also effective in treating human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. The IC~50~ of erlotinib was lower in PANC-1 cells (IC~50~ = 3.1 μM) compared to human primary cells (IC~50~ = 7

Prompt:  S5667 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5667 is a drug that targets cell-surface β-galactoside-binding proteins and inhibits the β-galactoside-specific lectin-like receptor expressed on cancer cells and cells of the innate immune system. It is designed to have the same mechanism of action as natural β-galactosides, but to lack their toxic side effects. S5667 was evaluated in two phase I clinical trials in patients with solid tumours and lymphomas. The primary objective of the trials was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of S5667 in these patients. Patients received single intravenous infusions of S5667 or its solvent, dextrose. S5667 was well tolerated at doses up to 1,000 mg/m(2). There was a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of diarrhoea at the highest dose tested (1,000 mg/m(2)).

In order to explore the role of SIRT1 in regulating *Tcf21* expression, we overexpressed SIRT1 in *Tcf21*-deficient MEFs. SIRT1 overexpression was sufficient to rescue *Tcf21* expression in these cells (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}a). SIRT1 has been shown to regulate *Tcf21* expression through deacetylation of histone H4 \[[@CR10]\].

Response: S5701 is a drug that targets MPS1 (also known as KU, MKI, MNS1) and is approved for the treatment of advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ([@B7]). MPS1 is a protein kinase that is essential for both spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation during mitosis ([@B14]; [@B17]). Its inhibition has been shown to result in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, followed by apoptosis ([@B14]; [@B17]).

In addition to its role in mitosis, MPS1 is also involved in DNA repair and genomic stability. MPS1 plays a role in both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways of DNA repair ([@B3]). The NHEJ pathway

Prompt:  S5703 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5703 is a drug that targets a component of the protein translation machinery that is also targeted by LMB, which results in a decreased expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, BAX and BAK, and of their downstream effector molecules, including PUMA, NOXA, and BID ([@B59], [@B60]). These events are believed to promote the accumulation of BAX and BAK in the mitochondrial membrane and the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Although these two drugs are quite different, the effect on the expression of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins and their effector molecules is remarkably similar, and both lead to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.

Prompt:  S5705 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5705 is a drug that targets the JAK2 kinase, which is required for signaling by a wide variety of cytokines. The specificity of S5705 is limited to the JAK2 enzyme, with little or no effect on other kinases. S5705 is orally bioavailable, and can be administered as a single dose. In an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, S5705 reduced joint swelling and inflammation, with no observable toxicity.
S5705 has been tested in several Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and has been shown to be well tolerated. The maximum tolerated dose in humans is 10 mg/kg, with plasma exposure increasing with increasing doses. The compound has been found to be a potent inhibitor of JAK2 kinase activity in vitro. In one clinical trial, S5705 was given orally to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,

Response: S5706 is a drug that targets an integrin on the surface of the virus and prevents it from attaching to host cells, and it has shown promise in clinical trials for the treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Although the drug is relatively well tolerated, it can cause potentially severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphylaxis in patients treated with the drug is around 1% in clinical trials. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of IgE antibodies to this drug in individuals with anaphylaxis in order to identify those at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to the drug.

In a population of adults with anaphylaxis, 8 of 39 patients had IgE antibodies to S5706. In addition, in 5 of these 8 patients, serum IgE levels to S5706 were measured and were significantly higher than in those without antibodies.

Prompt:  S5709 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5709 is a drug that targets the p38 MAPK pathway in lung cancer cells, and therefore, it is expected that in a lung cancer cell line with constitutive activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, sensitivity to the drug is enhanced. To confirm this hypothesis, we evaluated the response of lung cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-FU/S5709 combination treatment in vitro. To determine whether 5-FU sensitivity was enhanced in cells with constitutive activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, we established stable transfectants of the lung cancer cell line A549 (p38α-KM) and A549 (p38β-KM) cells expressing dominant-negative p38α or p38β, respectively. A549 (p38α-KM) and A549 (p38β-KM) cells were more sensitive to 5-FU than A549 cells ([Fig. 3A](

Response: S5710 is a drug that targets GSK3β. It is a first-in-class, orally available, small molecule GSK3β inhibitor that has been investigated in clinical trials for a number of CNS disorders. It has been found to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, Parkinson's disease, and other CNS disorders (C. B. Nicholson, Curr. Drug Targets, 2009, 10, 447-459). However, in clinical trials it has also been associated with significant GI toxicity (J. D. Steiner, Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol., 2009, 65, 786-791; J. D. Steiner, Ann. Rep. Med.

Prompt:  S5712 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5712 is a drug that targets TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase, thereby promoting neurite outgrowth. The mouse sciatic nerve was isolated and cultured *in vitro* for 6 days, and then incubated with A5712 at different concentrations (0.5--50 μM) for 12 h. The length of the longest neurite was measured and the average neurite length was calculated. The results showed that A5712 dose-dependently promoted neurite outgrowth (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). A5712 at 50 μM, the highest concentration used in the study, significantly increased the average neurite length to 144.7 ± 7.5 μm (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type="fig"}). These results indicated that TrkA plays a role in regulating axon outgrowth in the mouse sciatic nerve.

Prompt:  S5730 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5730 is a drug that targets the high affinity Ca2+-binding site of CaM, a ubiquitous Ca2+-dependent protein that plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation and death. In addition to its direct interaction with CaM, CaM also binds to the high affinity Ca2+-binding site of several other Ca2+-binding proteins, including calmodulin kinase II, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and calreticulin. We show here that S5730 selectively inhibits the proliferation of cells with high affinity Ca2+-binding sites, including HL60 cells and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

Prompt:  S5732 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5732 is a drug that targets the serotonin transporter (SERT) and was originally developed as a treatment for depression. SERT is a protein expressed by presynaptic neurons that reuptakes serotonin from the synaptic cleft back into the neurons where it was released. Inhibiting SERT leads to increased extracellular serotonin levels, which is thought to have antidepressant effects. SERT inhibitors are now being investigated for use in the treatment of other disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and eating disorders.

S5732 has been shown to be active in animal models of depression, but the potential for human use is limited by its poor oral bioavailability. In order to develop S5732 into a new antidepressant, a new formulation of the drug was required. A liquid formulation of S5732 was developed, but this was poorly tolerated by the animals used in the animal model studies. In order to make a more acceptable formulation of S5732, a lipid nanoparticle formulation

Prompt:  S5733 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S5733 is a drug that targets the cGMP pathway by inhibiting the degradation of cGMP by PDE5. This leads to a higher level of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which results in relaxation of the smooth muscle in the penile arteries and veins. The drug has been shown to increase the rate of penile erection in men with erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil is available in generic and brand versions, and can be taken orally as a tablet or sublingually as a lozenge.

Penile erection is a reflexive process, which requires both central and peripheral neural input. The central neural component involves an interplay of neurotransmitters, including nitric oxide, dopamine, histamine, and prostaglandins, which act in the brain to initiate the reflex. The peripheral component is initiated by penile nerves, which send signals to the autonomic nervous system to cause relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavern

Prompt:  S7668-Picropodophyllin is a drug that targets
 
Response: S7668-Picropodophyllin is a drug that targets and blocks the action of cyclin-dependent kinases. The drug has shown some promise in the treatment of multiple myeloma and some types of solid tumours. The drug was originally isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces picropodophyllinicus. It is now synthesised using a modified fermentation technique that has allowed the production of up to 1 g of the drug per litre of fermentation broth. It is now available for sale in tablet form as a prescription drug in the United States.

The development of picropodophyllin for the treatment of cancer was based on the hypothesis that cyclin-dependent kinases are overexpressed in a number of human cancers and that this overexpression leads to a selective growth advantage for tumour cells. Picropodophyllin has been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells in vitro. For example, the drug

Prompt:  S9001 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9001 is a drug that targets S9Q for proteasome degradation ([@bib20]).

In summary, we have shown that the FK506-binding protein FKBP38 can be targeted to the proteasome by its two N-terminal FK506-binding domains, and that this occurs in a proteasome-dependent manner. This interaction appears to be crucial for the function of FKBP38, as in the absence of FKBP38 the proteasome is not recruited to the S9Q, and this in turn leads to loss of proteasome activity. The interaction between FKBP38 and the proteasome is also observed in intact cells, indicating that the interaction is physiologically relevant.

Prompt:  S9003 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9003 is a drug that targets the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a group of signaling molecules involved in normal development and tissue maintenance. In normal cells, Hh signaling regulates cell growth and differentiation, whereas in cancer cells, the pathway is constitutively active and is involved in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and survival^[@CR19],[@CR20]^.

To investigate the effects of S9003 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human glioma cells, we performed an MTT assay and flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. S9003 inhibited the proliferation of human glioma cells, with an IC~50~ of \~3.5 μM (Fig. [1a, b](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}).

Prompt:  S9015 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9015 is a drug that targets the nuclear receptor PPARγ. It is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As we previously reported, S9015 is a more potent PPARγ agonist than rosiglitazone. In this study, we investigated the effects of S9015 on adipose tissue. We found that S9015 induced PPARγ-dependent upregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in adipose tissue. S9015 also induced PPARγ-dependent upregulation of PPARγ target genes in adipose tissue. These effects were accompanied by improved glucose tolerance in mice treated with S9015. Our findings indicate that S9015 can be used to improve adipose tissue function and that PPARγ is a key mediator of the beneficial effects of S9015 on glucose homeostasis.

In this study, we developed a new compound S9024-Nano, which exhibits excellent tumor inhibition activity and good safety in vivo. Our results demonstrated that S9024-Nano could induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, while had no effect on normal cells. The drug had a relatively long half-life in the blood and liver, and was not affected by CYP450, thus it has better oral bioavailability. We also found that the compound could induce cell cycle arrest in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, S9024-Nano had good anti-metastatic effect in vivo. In addition, the compound had no significant side effects on heart, liver, spleen and kidney in mice. In summary, we found that S9024-Nano was an effective drug for pancreatic cancer therapy,

Prompt:  S9042 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9042 is a drug that targets the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. The GABA-A receptor is a pentamer of subunits, each containing a membrane-spanning pore and a transmembrane domain. The transmembrane domain contains a ligand-binding site, and the transmembrane domains are arranged in a closely packed configuration to form a channel pore. The channel pore allows chloride ions to flow into the cell when the GABA-A receptor is activated. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA-A receptors mediate most of the fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain. S9042 is a partial agonist of the GABA-A receptor. S9042 binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor, and activates the GABA-A receptor by displacing an endogenous allosteric modulator, such as Zolpidem

Prompt:  S9110 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9110 is a drug that targets cancer cells through inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway. By promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells, S9110 is a potential anti-cancer drug that has been used in the treatment of cancer patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM) ([@B18], [@B19]). However, S9110 also induces apoptosis in normal human cells, which limits its clinical application ([@B20]). Therefore, developing a drug that specifically targets tumor cells and has little or no effect on normal cells is of great significance for the clinical treatment of patients with MDS or MM.

To solve this problem, in this study, we synthesized a new derivative of S9110, S9010, which specifically targets tumor cells through the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. Our results show that S9010 is an effective drug that induces apoptosis in cancer cells.

Response: S9142 is a drug that targets the folate receptor and has been used for the treatment of malignant diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and head and neck cancer ([@B37]). To determine whether GLV-S9142 is a substrate of ABCC11, we performed cell viability assays and found that GLV-S9142 had no effect on the cell viability of ABCC11-overexpressing cells (data not shown). In addition, we evaluated the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent substrate of GLV-S9142, and the fluorescent intensity in ABCC11-overexpressing cells was lower than that in control cells (Figures [7](#F7){ref-type="fig"}A,B). Therefore, ABCC11 overexpression was associated with the efflux of GLV-S9142.

Prompt:  S9171 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9171 is a drug that targets the Hedgehog pathway, thereby suppressing tumor growth in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer \[[@B23-cancers-11-00561]\]. We examined the effect of S9171 on LNCaP cells. We found that the expression of genes associated with cell growth was suppressed in LNCaP cells treated with S9171, but this did not cause cell death. S9171 also suppressed the growth of DU145 cells ([Figure 3](#cancers-11-00561-f003){ref-type="fig"}). These results suggest that S9171 is not toxic to normal prostate cells. However, its effects on prostate cancer cells are not limited to cell growth suppression, as it also inhibits the migratory and invasive abilities of these cells.

Response: S9224 is a drug that targets thrombin, which is known to be involved in inflammation and is found in elevated levels in the CSF of patients with AD.

Response: S9240 is a drug that targets c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 and induces apoptosis in many types of cancer cells.^[@bib1]^ It is well known that the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl can be increased by JNK activation.^[@bib2]^ In addition, c-Jun is phosphorylated by JNK1/2, which leads to c-Jun dimerization and its subsequent activation.^[@bib3]^ Furthermore, c-Jun can transactivate the expression of other anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1.^[@bib4],\ [@bib5]^ Thus, it is conceivable that S9240 may inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. However, S9240

Prompt:  S9248 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9248 is a drug that targets the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is frequently activated in various human cancers. We evaluated the effect of combined S9248 and gemcitabine treatment on the viability of pancreatic cancer cell lines and examined the mechanism of the S9248/gemcitabine combination. S9248 and gemcitabine both suppressed the viability of human pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1, BxPC-3, Capan-2, and AsPC-1) and were synergistic. Treatment with S9248 and gemcitabine significantly decreased the viability of Panc-1 cells, which were more sensitive to S9248 than to gemcitabine. S9248 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, whereas gemcitabine induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis. S9248 also increased the sub-G1 population and cleaved caspase-3 in Panc

Response: S9263 is a drug that targets the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and protects against ischemic brain damage. The authors assessed whether it had similar neuroprotective effects as established mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA). S9263 was administered i.v. at doses of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/h, starting immediately after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in rats. Control animals received CsA or saline. Animals were sacrificed 2 h after the end of the 4-h period of cardiac arrest, and cortical samples were taken for analyses of the tissue levels of the mPTP and its inhibitor, cyclophilin D (CypD), as well as of apoptosis. To assess the effect of S9263 on cerebral blood flow, autoradiography was performed in brain sections of animals treated with CsA or S9263. Both S9263 and Cs

Response: S9270 is a drug that targets the drug-transporter protein P-gp.

Prompt:  S9281 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9281 is a drug that targets a unique molecular target, the ATM kinase. A previous study demonstrated that S9281 was active in a broad range of cancer cells with high-ATM protein expression, but inactive in cells with low-ATM protein expression. The S9281 IC~50~ value was in the range of 0.1--0.4 μM in various cancer cell lines with high-ATM protein expression, whereas the IC~50~ value in cell lines with low-ATM protein expression was around 30 μM ([@B20]). Our study showed that S9281 was highly active against LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cell lines. In addition, S9281 inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

To explore the possible molecular mechanism underlying the effects of S9281, we examined the expression of ATM protein in DU145 and PC-

Prompt:  S9285 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9285 is a drug that targets BRCA2. It is derived from a natural product. It is a compound that is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and metastatic pancreatic cancer. It also has an ability to inhibit other cancer types. BRCA2 is a gene that is involved in the repair of double strand breaks. It is involved in maintaining the stability of the genome. It is mutated in familial breast cancer. BRCA2 can be inactivated by gene mutation. In this case, a drug can be used to target this mutated gene and affect the progression of the disease.

Prompt:  S9288 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9288 is a drug that targets the expression of GALNT3, an enzyme involved in the addition of a poly-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine glycan to the O-glycosylation of the integrin α6β4, a member of the integrin family of cell surface receptors. These receptors mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and are involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signalling^[@R14],[@R15]^. The inhibition of GALNT3 expression was previously shown to cause down-regulation of integrin α6β4 expression in T cells^[@R16]^. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of GALNT3 expression in T cells by S9288 would decrease the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells and thus reduce the development of EAE. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with a single dose of S9288 at day

Prompt:  S9294 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9294 is a drug that targets PIP5K2A and is currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of malignant glioma (NCT03237768).

As a proof-of-principle, we tested the potential of PIP5K2A as a therapeutic target in the orthotopic 4T1 model. We chose to treat the orthotopic 4T1 model with PIP5K2A inhibitor since this model better recapitulates the microenvironment of the malignant brain tumor compared to subcutaneous injection models \[[@B30-cancers-12-01561]\]. However, the intravenous administration of the PIP5K2A inhibitor was not successful in our orthotopic 4T1 model. We speculate that the therapeutic effect of PIP5K2A inhibitor is limited by the high BBB integrity and low permeability of the BBB. Further studies to enhance the perme

Prompt:  S9311 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9311 is a drug that targets the NADPH oxidase complex and is currently being tested in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumours (NCT02042314). In addition, the drug has been shown to have potent anti-cancer effects in mouse models of breast and ovarian cancer (Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., [@B22]; Narayanan et al., [@B38]). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by Sesn2 is an attractive mechanism to reduce oxidative stress and suppress tumour progression, and the present data suggests that this could be achieved by targeting a single protein (i.e., Sesn2) rather than a multi-protein complex.

In conclusion, we show that the lipid phosphatase Sesn2 is a novel tumour suppressor that acts in part by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production. Furthermore, we show that targeting Sesn

Response: S9321 is a drug that targets the mTOR pathway and can inhibit proliferation of B cell lymphoma cells in vivo. Moreover, in our preliminary study, the combination of ATRA and S3291 can synergistically inhibit the proliferation of CLL cells. This combination may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of CLL.

Prompt:  S9326 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9326 is a drug that targets a different protein, SMN2. It's a copy of the SMN1 gene, which is the gene that causes SMA. When the SMA2 protein makes more copies of itself, the result is less SMA2. It's just that the SMA2 protein is not found in cells of the spinal cord and brain. The SMA2 protein is found in muscles. That's why SMA patients have difficulty moving their muscles. The SMA2 protein helps to connect the nerve cells to the muscles.

So how does an enzyme called SMN help to make the SMA2 protein? The SMA2 protein has to be linked to other proteins, called splicing factors. One of these splicing factors is called U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2). The SMA2 protein must be linked to U2AF2 to work.

Prompt:  S9338 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9338 is a drug that targets proteins that are important in the replication of HIV and SIV. It has been shown to be active in vitro against HIV-1 and HIV-2, SIVmac251, SIVmac251/H and SIV/H1 (Lu et al., [@B37]). S9338 is an orally available, pan-inhibitor of all three RT classes, with an EC~50~ of 0.19 nM (in the case of HIV-1) and 0.05 nM (in the case of HIV-2) (Lu et al., [@B37]).

Prompt:  S9344 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9344 is a drug that targets Rv3330c, which is part of a multidrug efflux pump that is involved in drug efflux in M. tuberculosis. As expected, S9344 alone did not affect growth, and did not significantly enhance the activity of isoniazid, pyrazinamide or ethambutol against M. tuberculosis. This suggests that S9344 is not acting by blocking drug efflux. It also suggests that the mechanism of action of S9344 does not involve its known target, Rv3330c.

Another new compound that is likely to target a novel mechanism of action is [D]{.smallcaps}-cycloserine. D-cycloserine is a broad-spectrum agonist of the mGluR1 receptor and a partial agonist of the NMDAR receptor, which are involved in glutamate signalling in the brain and may play a role in the control of bacterial replication.

Prompt:  S9348 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9348 is a drug that targets AMPA receptors (AMPARs). It acts as an antagonist at the glutamate binding site and has a low affinity for NMDARs, suggesting that it is not a conventional NMDAR antagonist. S9348 has a half-life of approximately 30 min, and the plasma level of S9348 is much lower than the brain level ([@B24]). S9348 has been used in the *in vivo* rodent studies of HD models ([@B19], [@B25]). It has been shown that S9348 can improve motor and cognitive deficits and reverse the abnormalities of synaptic transmission in HD mice ([@B19]). S9348 has been shown to be effective in rescuing motor deficits and improving cognitive impairment in a murine model of HD ([@B25]).

Response: S9349 is a drug that targets integrin αvβ3. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that S9349 can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in various cancer models, including breast, prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancer^[@CR39]--[@CR42]^. A phase I clinical trial is currently underway to determine the safety and efficacy of S9349 in advanced solid tumors. Here, we showed that S9349 was able to suppress pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, which were correlated with its effects on integrin αvβ3, AKT, and ERK signaling pathways. Importantly, we showed that S9349 suppressed metastatic colonization of pancreatic cancer cells in the liver, as indicated by a reduction in liver metastases. Our findings support the development of S9349 as a potential therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer.

The underlying mechanisms of pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion are complicated.

Prompt:  S9351 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9351 is a drug that targets AMPA receptors and it is an allosteric modulator of the glutamate site. As AMPA receptors are a major target of many drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders, including anxiety and schizophrenia, it is not surprising that S9351 produces an anxiolytic effect in rodents.^[@ref11],[@ref28]^ It is thought that S9351 acts in the CNS by potentiating the actions of endogenous glutamate at AMPA receptors, and it has been suggested that this may have beneficial effects in CNS disorders associated with glutamatergic dysfunction.^[@ref11],[@ref28]^

Response: S9354 is a drug that targets p53. Inhibition of p53 by AdS9354 in tumour cells leads to increased expression of p21 and the subsequent inhibition of the cell cycle. We therefore hypothesized that combined therapy of AdS9354 with MMC may improve the antitumour activity. MMC was administered at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg as a single agent or at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg with AdS9354 at the dose of 1.0 × 10^7^ PFU as a single agent. To determine the optimal treatment sequence, tumour growth was monitored in nude mice bearing BGC823 xenografts.

Response: S9383 is a drug that targets the ribosomal protein S9 (rpS9) and inhibits protein synthesis ([@B10]). The efficacy of S9383 has been shown in preclinical and clinical studies in hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ([@B11]--[@B13]).

When S9400 was administered to mice, the drug had no effect on the number of grid cells in CA1, but instead reduced the number of place cells in the dentate gyrus, suggesting that S9400 does not affect grid cells. When S9400 was administered to rats, it also had no effect on the number of grid cells in CA1, but reduced the number of place cells in the dentate gyrus, suggesting that S9400 does not affect grid cells in rats.

A study in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS) found that S9400 reduces both the number of grid cells and the size of grid cells, suggesting that S9400 may have potential as a treatment for FXS.

Prompt:  S9500 is a drug that targets
 
Response: S9500 is a drug that targets the BRAF V600E mutation in melanoma, causing it to become less aggressive.

First, the study found that the drug slowed the growth of existing tumors, but it was less effective at shrinking tumors that were already in the middle of growing. This is important because most people who have the BRAF mutation will not benefit from the drug.

"That means that a substantial proportion of patients who are going to get this drug may not get any benefit from it," said Dr. Andrzej Rydzik, director of the Abramson Cancer Center and a co-author of the study. "It's not that the drug isn't effective, but that it's not effective enough."

The study also found that the drug was safe, and it did not cause serious side effects. However, patients taking the drug had more skin problems and acne-like skin conditions than those who did not take the drug.

Prompt:  Saccharin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Saccharin is a drug that targets the sweet taste receptor, which is one of the five types of taste receptors. These receptors are found on the tongue, and when they bind to their respective sweet tastants, they are activated. When they are activated, they cause the release of the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which triggers a sensation of sweetness in the brain.

The effect of these taste receptors is to activate the brain, which in turn releases the neurotransmitter, glutamate. This neurotransmitter triggers a sensation of sweetness.

Prompt:  Sapropterin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sapropterin is a drug that targets the enzyme 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) in the salvage pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis. It is the first drug approved for treatment of children with PKU, and it is also being investigated as a potential treatment for other disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The primary route of elimination of sapropterin is through urinary excretion, but the renal clearance of sapropterin is substantially less than the glomerular filtration rate. However, due to the small amount of BH4 produced in the kidney, its elimination is relatively slow. Because of the poor renal clearance, it is often recommended that sapropterin be administered in divided doses throughout the day to avoid accumulation in the body.

Sapropterin is available as the tartrate salt of sapropterin dihydrochloride

Prompt:  Sevoflurane is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sevoflurane is a drug that targets and activates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors. Sevoflurane acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, which increase the affinity of GABA at GABA A receptors \[[@B1]\]. A positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors enhances the actions of GABA A receptors by increasing the sensitivity of GABA A receptors to the agonist \[[@B2]\]. Sevoflurane has a rapid onset and short duration of action \[[@B3]\]. Although a study showed that sevoflurane can induce changes in brain function \[[@B4]\], few studies have been performed on the pharmacological properties of sevoflurane on the brain and spinal cord.

Many studies have shown that isoflurane or sevoflurane can be used as an anesthetic

Prompt:  (S)-Glutamic is a drug that targets
 
Response: (S)-Glutamic is a drug that targets glial cells in the brain, which have the ability to remove excess glutamate from the synapses.

It is known to have some effects on the brain, including causing more sleep, reducing depression and anxiety, and improving cognition.

Its effects have been attributed to its effects on glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that helps neurons communicate with one another.

Glutamate is made up of two parts, glutamic acid and glutamine.

(S)-Glutamic acid is the form of glutamate that makes up about 85% of the total glutamate in the body, and (S)-glutamic acid is the form that the body is most likely to break down to make energy.

It is believed that when the body has a surplus of (S)-glutamic acid, it is converted into (S)-glutamic acid, which then gets broken down to form

Prompt:  Sildenafil is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sildenafil is a drug that targets a very important enzyme, the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). This enzyme is found in the blood vessels and the erectile tissues of the penis. It is the reason behind the fact that the male is unable to achieve an erection, during sexual intercourse. When Sildenafil comes in contact with the PDE5 enzyme, it prevents it from breaking down the cGMP that is produced in the erectile tissues of the penis. This prevents the blood from being diverted away from the erectile tissues and allows the penis to become erect. Sildenafil has also been shown to be useful in cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Sildenafil is marketed as Viagra in many countries. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved it for erectile dysfunction (ED) and PAH.

Prompt:  Sinomenine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sinomenine is a drug that targets multiple cell types, including cancer cells, making it a potential candidate for use in a wide range of cancers. We have previously demonstrated that sinefungin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the TGF-β receptor type I (ALK5) kinase and has activity in a wide range of solid and hematologic tumors in vitro and in vivo \[[@R1]--[@R3]\].

ALK5 is a member of the type I receptor family of tyrosine kinases, which also includes ALK1 and ALK2, and functions as a mediator of TGF-β signaling. In contrast to other members of the receptor family, ALK5 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, and therefore, the activation of this receptor is mediated by binding to a ligand. ALK5 activation leads to phosphorylation of downstream effectors and activation of SMAD transcription factors, which play an important role in

Prompt:  (S)-(?)-Limonene is a drug that targets
 
Response: (S)-(?)-Limonene is a drug that targets leukocytes, and there is a need to further understand the mechanism of its effects. In this study, we observed the effects of (-)limonene on cell growth, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and Ca2+ influx in HL-60 cells. The results showed that (-)limonene suppressed the growth of HL-60 cells, but did not influence phagocytosis and ROS production. The (-)limonene-induced growth suppression was mediated by inhibiting the Ca2+ influx in the cells. The results suggest that (-)limonene could suppress the growth of leukocytes by inhibiting the Ca2+ influx.

Prompt:  Sodium is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sodium is a drug that targets the kidneys, the central nervous system and the heart. Sodium retention causes edema, which causes the heart to pump harder, increasing cardiac output and blood pressure.

The disease was first identified in 1962. At that time, there were about a million cases in the United States and a quarter of a million in England. Since then, the number of cases has decreased, but it remains a major cause of death.

The disease is characterized by sodium retention in the kidney, which leads to a high blood pressure and a high cardiac output. The high blood pressure causes damage to the kidneys, the heart and the brain.

The heart is the first organ to suffer damage. The kidneys and the brain are damaged later.

The disease is named after Sir William Osler, a Canadian physician who introduced a classification of edema. He named the disease “Edema Salient,” or “Osler’s Edema

The active drug in the drug is streptomycin, which is produced by the Streptomyces griseus species.

It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that interferes with the synthesis of bacterial ribosomes. It is bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria, including mycobacteria and streptococci, but it is inactive against Gram-negative bacteria. It binds to the ribosome 50S subunit and prevents protein synthesis. The bactericidal effect is mediated by binding to the 30S subunit and interfering with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. The binding of stre

Response: Streptozocin is a drug that targets pancreatic β cells. In rats, the β cells are destroyed within 3--4 days after a single administration of streptozocin. The effects of repeated administration of streptozocin on the pancreas are still unknown. We investigated the effects of repeated administration of streptozocin on the pancreatic islets of the rat. Rats were administered streptozocin by a single injection or a daily administration of streptozocin for 10 days. Islets were isolated and assayed for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, for the effects of streptozocin on islet insulin content, and for islet insulin content after an acute streptozocin treatment. We also investigated the effects of an acute streptozocin treatment on the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the rat islets. The results of these experiments suggest that the islets can be damaged

Response: Suberohydroxamic is a drug that targets the protein histone deacetylase, and may have some potential in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

When a person is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, their body’s immune system becomes aggressive, attacking their own joints and causing inflammation and swelling.

“As this inflammation spreads, it can be painful and often causes joint stiffness and pain,” explains Dr. Mukherjee. “The symptoms can also include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.”

The condition can be very difficult to manage, and most patients eventually need to take disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, as well as anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs.

The drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis are often quite toxic, and patients are at risk of developing adverse side effects.

Prompt:  Succimer is a drug that targets
 
Response: Succimer is a drug that targets a unique protein found in a specific type of bacteria called streptococci. It works by preventing the bacteria from using glucose for energy. The lack of energy causes the bacteria to slow down or die. This is the basis for the drug’s potential to treat infection-related problems. It is not clear how it works, but the drug has been shown to be effective against at least one type of streptococci infection.

Infection with streptococci can lead to severe conditions, such as strep throat. However, infections with streptococci can be prevented by using the drug that is approved for the treatment of strep throat. The drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of strep throat. The drug is also approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of a number of types of strep throat. It is available in a tablet form that is used for a few days

Response: Succinylcholine is a drug that targets the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) to stimulate skeletal muscle and is used in surgical anesthesia. This agent is also used as an emergency drug in the management of life-threatening conditions such as acute myasthenia gravis (AMG), status epilepticus, and poisoning ([@B1]). Despite its widespread use, the effects of succinylcholine have not been thoroughly investigated in the literature.

Since succinylcholine is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, it has a risk of complications, such as postoperative muscle weakness, malignant hyperthermia (MH), and pulmonary dysfunction ([@B2], [@B3]).

Although the exact mechanism of succinylcholine-induced MH has not been elucidated, it is assumed that an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration ([@B4]) may be a key mechanism

Prompt:  sucralose is a drug that targets
 
Response: sucralose is a drug that targets the sweet taste receptors. The idea behind this is that it will provide a milder taste to foods that otherwise would taste too sweet. The theory behind this is that sucrase is one of the first enzymes to break down sugars in the mouth. This would allow for the other enzymes to work faster. This would also help to prevent or delay the formation of dental caries and cavities. The thought behind this is that if you can delay the formation of dental caries and cavities, then you can reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth and therefore the risk of developing cavities.

Sucralose is one of the first artificial sweeteners. Sucralose is a sugar substitute. It is a synthetic sweetener. This is because it was created by a company called Cereal Partners Worldwide. The sweetener is a mixture of molecules that look and taste like sugar. The molecule in sucralose is the chemical structure of suc

Prompt:  Sulfamerazine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Sulfamerazine is a drug that targets methionine synthase and inhibits methionine synthase. The inhibition of methionine synthase causes cell death by the depletion of the methionine-rich amino acid pool and the reduction of methylation capacity.

Methionine synthase is an enzyme that plays a central role in the metabolism of methionine. Methionine synthase is present in all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, and it catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine synthase is also present in all animal tissues, but the enzyme is primarily found in liver, kidney, and brain. The human gene for methionine synthase is known as MTR.

Drugs that inhibit methionine synthase have been shown to be useful in the treatment of cancer. In one study, an MTR inhibitor was shown to reduce the proliferation of human melanoma cells in vitro

In recent years, a large number of compounds have been synthesized and tested in vitro for the inhibition of tyrosinase, but only a few of them have been used in vivo for the treatment of hyperpigmentation.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the topical application of the anti-tyrosinase compound of celastrol on the skin pigmentation in the hairless mouse model.

Methods

The topical treatment of hairless mice with talniflumate was performed twice daily, for 2 weeks, using a solution containing 1% of the drug in a vehicle of the same formulation as that used for the preparation of the emulsion. The vehicle was applied to the control group of mice.

Response: Tartaric is a drug that targets mitochondria. It has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of a number of different diseases. The development of tartaric acid as a drug is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.
In the development of tartaric acid as a drug, a tartaric acid salt of the amino acid proline is a particularly useful starting material. For example, if proline is combined with a base, the salt of the resulting compound with an acid is usually formed. The resulting salt is often isolated, and then dissolved in water to yield a solution of the salt. If the salt is not isolated, then a solution of the salt is usually formed directly. The solution of the salt is then converted to a hydrate of the salt, usually by addition of water to the solution.
Anhydrous tartaric acid is often formed by treatment of the salt with anhydrous acetic acid. However, this requires the use of a large

Prompt:  TAS-116 is a drug that targets
 
Response: TAS-116 is a drug that targets the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT). The high affinity of TAS-116 for the SERT is believed to contribute to its antidepressant efficacy. However, a number of clinical studies suggest that TAS-116 also has efficacy in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
TAS-116 is a drug that has been extensively studied in humans, and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.
TAS-116 was first described in the literature by Hirsch et al. (J. Med. Chem. 41, 881-888, 1998). The compound is a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, and is a potent inhibitor of 5-HT reuptake.

Prompt:  TAS-120 is a drug that targets
 
Response: TAS-120 is a drug that targets a previously unrecognized mechanism of action. It appears to increase the bioavailability of naltrexone in the gut, thus increasing the absorption of naltrexone into the systemic circulation and subsequently enhancing the binding of naltrexone to opioid receptors. By increasing the binding of naltrexone to opioid receptors, the potential for a dose-related side effect is reduced.

Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that was first used as a treatment for alcohol and opioid addiction. Its effectiveness is now being studied in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gastrointestinal condition in which the symptoms are similar to those of opioid withdrawal, including abdominal pain and diarrhea. Naltrexone has been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of IBS in a controlled clinical trial.

To further understand the mechanism of action of TAS-120, researchers have conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled

At present, there are two known methods for obtaining taurine: one is extraction from egg yolk, and the other is synthesis from glycine and sulfate. The main disadvantage of the extraction method is that a large number of eggs are needed, which leads to high production cost and severe egg pollution. The synthesis method has the disadvantage of producing taurine with a low yield.

Prompt:  Taxifolin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Taxifolin is a drug that targets M2 receptors of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and has shown efficacy in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease. The binding of ligands to M2 receptors results in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and the inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) [3]. The latter results in the phosphorylation of the voltage-dependent potassium channel (Kv) [4]. Inhibition of Kv channels leads to the depolarization of the cell membrane and to an increase in intracellular calcium levels. This calcium overload triggers the activation of proteases and induces neuronal apoptosis.

The molecular docking study was carried out using the Sybyl software (Tripos, St. Louis, MO, USA). The protein structure of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (PDB code: 4RH7) was used as the receptor structure and the energy minimized structure

We studied the clinical use of a new carbapenem, tebipenem, for the treatment of acute bacterial infections in patients and the antibacterial activity of this drug against common bacterial species isolated from these patients. We also evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates to tebipenem.

Antimicrobial agents are used extensively for the treatment of various bacterial infections, but increasing resistance of bacterial isolates to these agents is a major clinical problem. The major route of antibiotic resistance development is the acquisition of resistance genes. Bacteria can acquire these resistance genes by plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms or by chromosomal mutation. The most important mechanism of resistance to beta-lactams is the production of beta-lactamases. The

It is currently unclear whether there is a dose--response relationship for the pre-treatment effect of PARP inhibitors. We previously showed that there was a dose--response relationship for the effect of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer ([@bib10]). However, there was no pre-treatment effect of carboplatin in a phase I trial of olaparib in patients with advanced solid tumours ([@bib2]).

Prompt:  Thioridazine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Thioridazine is a drug that targets dopamine receptors.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, in the brain. Dopamine is responsible for the “reward” response in the brain, or the sense of pleasure that you feel after eating something good.

You know this. It’s been around for ages. The earliest known use of dopamine for psychiatric treatment was in the 1950s. The reason that it is effective is that it mimics the dopamine response to the “reward” you feel after eating something good.

If you don’t get a reward response, your brain will feel unfulfilled and won’t want to engage in the behavior.

Thioridazine (aka phenothiazine) is a chemical that targets the dopamine receptors. It’s a classic antipsychotic. The original discovery was made in 1957. It’s also known as tr

Prompt:  Thiostrepton is a drug that targets
 
Response: Thiostrepton is a drug that targets the tumor cells in a number of ways. One of these ways is by blocking the protein that allows the cancer cells to multiply. The protein is called ribonucleotide reductase and it helps cancer cells to make DNA that allows them to multiply. The thiostrepton drug blocks the ribonucleotide reductase and that causes the cancer cells to stop multiplying. This drug is effective against many types of cancers.

When the cancer is first discovered, it is usually not possible to say for sure what type of cancer it is. A doctor will do a biopsy to find out if it is a type of cancer that is known to be sensitive to thiostrepton. This will tell the doctor whether the cancer is sensitive to thiostrepton. This will help to determine the best treatment plan for the patient.

Prompt:  Thonzylamine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Thonzylamine is a drug that targets acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and has the potential to cause drug-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) ([@bib1]). In PD, there is a decrease in the concentration of ACh in the striatum and substantia nigra, which causes the motor symptoms associated with the disease. However, the effect of thonzylamine on the dopaminergic system remains unclear. The level of dopamine (DA) in the brain is regulated by the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) ([@bib2]). The DA level in the brain is also influenced by the release of DA from nerve terminals in the striatum ([@bib3]). The striatal DA release is regulated by two distinct types of cholinergic inputs: direct cholinergic inputs from the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) to the striatum and indirect

Prompt:  Tiapride is a drug that targets
 
Response: Tiapride is a drug that targets the dopamine system and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute mania. The authors used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of nine patients with bipolar I disorder, treated with tiapride. The patients had been treated with tiapride monotherapy for a mean of 4.5 months. There was a significant correlation between the reduction in manic symptoms and the reduction in DAT binding in the PFC. The patients had significant reductions in DAT binding in the PFC, as well as in dopamine release in the PFC. These findings suggest that tiapride may have therapeutic effects in bipolar disorder by reducing dopamine release in the PFC.

Response: Tinoridine is a drug that targets the skin’s lipid layers. When applied to the skin, it disrupts the lipid layer, allowing the skin’s surface to absorb moisture and nutrients more efficiently. When used in the form of a foam, it also creates a barrier that allows moisture to penetrate the skin.

When applied to the skin, it creates a barrier that allows moisture to penetrate the skin.

Tinoridine has been found to be effective in treating acne and other skin conditions. In addition to its effectiveness, tinoridine has a good side effect profile and a clean and soothing feel. It’s also an ideal choice for treating acne on the face, because it has a more mild feel than benzoyl peroxide, and is less likely to dry out the skin.

Response: Tinostamustine(EDO-S101) is a drug that targets cells with a high proliferation rate such as tumors. However, the efficacy of EDO-S101 was reduced when compared to standard treatment with combination of Temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this discrepancy, we used the Human Genome U133A Plus 2.0 array to examine the changes in gene expression profile of EDO-S101-treated human glioma cells. We found that EDO-S101 induced cell death in human glioma cells through upregulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1. Furthermore, EDO-S101 induced apoptosis in human glioma cells through upregulation of p53 and p21. The ability of EDO-S101 to upregulate p

Prompt:  Tolbutamide is a drug that targets
 
Response: Tolbutamide is a drug that targets the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) of the beta-cell and promotes insulin secretion, potentially as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. One problem with this drug is that, at therapeutic doses, it induces a major reduction in the amount of pancreatic insulin, with severe consequences on glucose homeostasis. We have investigated the cellular mechanisms by which tolbutamide alters beta-cell function, focusing on the mitochondria. Our data indicate that, in the absence of mitochondrial membrane potential, tolbutamide does not increase the rate of insulin secretion but, in contrast, strongly inhibits insulin secretion. In addition, tolbutamide prevents the insulin-induced mitochondrial membrane potential increase and inhibits insulin secretion. Our data also indicate that the sensitivity of the mitochondria to tolbutamide is dependent on their state of activation and that tolbutamide induces a mitochondrial uncoupling. Thus, tolbutamide alters beta-cell function

Prompt:  TPX-0005 is a drug that targets
 
Response: TPX-0005 is a drug that targets cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclin-dependent kinases are enzymes that regulate the cell cycle. The activation of CDKs is a multi-step process. The first step is the binding of the regulatory subunit (cyclin) to the catalytic subunit (CDK). The second step is phosphorylation of the CDK. This is typically followed by binding of a third protein (a kinase inhibitor) that blocks the active site of the CDK. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are divided into two groups: those that affect both G1 and S phase (e.g. p21 and p27) and those that affect only S phase (e.g. p16 and p18). p21 and p27 are inhibitors of CDKs 2 and 4, respectively. CDK2 and CDK4 have a role in the transition from G1 to S phase.

Prompt:  Tranilast is a drug that targets
 
Response: Tranilast is a drug that targets protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a protein that is present in high concentrations in the liver. PTP1B regulates the function of a variety of proteins involved in cell growth, metabolism, and the immune system. It also regulates the function of enzymes involved in insulin signalling and glucose transport. Tranilast is an anti-inflammatory drug that has been used to treat a number of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, arthritis, and allergies.

Pharmacology

Tranilast has been used to treat psoriasis since the 1970s. It works by inhibiting PTP1B, an enzyme that can block the action of insulin. This causes the cells to increase their response to insulin, which stimulates the body's ability to store glucose in the form of glycogen. It also inhibits the inflammatory response of the body, which reduces the swelling of the skin.

Prompt:  TRECATOR is a drug that targets
 
Response: TRECATOR is a drug that targets a pathway in the cell that leads to enhanced cellular activity. In this pathway, the cell uses a group of chemicals called "tumor necrosis factors" (TNFs) to send out messages to the rest of the body. TNFs, which are released by the body to fight off infection, are also involved in various autoimmune diseases and other disorders. TRECATOR works by blocking the TNF signaling pathway, which is involved in the transmission of the TNF signals.

TRECATOR works by inhibiting a specific enzyme called "Receptor Activator of NF-κB" (RANK). RANK is involved in the signaling pathway by which the TNFs work. The RANK signal that is inhibited by TRECATOR is involved in causing inflammation, which is one of the first steps in the cascade of events that lead to cancer.

Prompt:  Trimebutine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Trimebutine is a drug that targets the cholinergic system and has been found to be effective in treating depression. It is believed that this effect is mediated by its ability to enhance cholinergic transmission. This study examined the potential of the trimebutine enantiomers to interact with muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) using in vitro radioligand binding assays. The results indicate that the R-enantiomer is an agonist for both M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors, while the S-enantiomer is an antagonist for both M1 and M2 receptors. The enantiomers were found to have low-to-moderate affinity for other muscarinic receptors, including the M4 receptor. Trimebutine was shown to have high affinity for the M4 receptor, which suggests that it may have potential as a M4 receptor-selective drug.

Prompt:  Triptolide is a drug that targets
 
Response: Triptolide is a drug that targets the protein called the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and blocks its function. Hsp90 is involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells, so blocking it inhibits cancer growth. Triptolide also blocks Hsp90’s ability to keep mutated genes from causing cancer, because these genes require Hsp90 for proper function.1

The evidence for the benefits of using triptolide for cancer is quite compelling. As described by the authors of the following review, “Triptolide has demonstrated activity in vitro and in vivo against many cancer cell lines, including human breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, and melanoma cell lines, and has been shown to induce apoptosis in these cell lines. In vivo, triptolide has been shown to be active against xenografts of human breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and against human melanoma xenografts.�

Response: Troglitazone is a drug that targets the insulin resistance, a major pathophysiological feature of type 2 diabetes. However, the adverse effects of troglitazone on liver have not been fully investigated. Here, we found that troglitazone exposure induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human liver cell line THP-1 cells. The pro-inflammatory effect was mediated by induction of the chemokine MCP-1, and was dependent on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. These data suggest that troglitazone may cause liver injury through its pro-inflammatory effect.

Prompt:  Tropic is a drug that targets
 
Response: Tropic is a drug that targets P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the primary efflux pump in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that removes potentially toxic drugs from the brain. The objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tropic in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. There is a large body of literature indicating that P-gp plays a significant role in drug transport across the BBB and that P-gp expression is increased in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Tropic has been shown to inhibit P-gp in vitro, to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) in human cancer cells, and to enhance the efficacy of many drugs in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Prompt:  Troxerutin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Troxerutin is a drug that targets AMPK and thereby improves the cellular metabolism of skeletal muscle. Troxerutin improves skeletal muscle function and metabolism by reducing lipid accumulation, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhancing insulin signaling. These effects are beneficial for treating metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other obesity-related conditions. In this study, we show that troxerutin is an AMPK activator, as evidenced by its ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream targets. In addition, troxerutin increases the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and decreases the phosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). These findings suggest that troxerutin improves insulin sensitivity and decreases gluconeogenesis by increasing AMPK phosphorylation.

Prompt:  TYZEKA is a drug that targets
 
Response: TYZEKA is a drug that targets both wild-type and mutated p53. We previously demonstrated that ZYTIMA, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, causes a similar response to that of ZYTIMA in cells that express mutated p53 (H1299) \[[@R22]\]. Thus, we chose ZYTIMA as a positive control to test the sensitivity of cells with wt p53 to a compound targeting both wt and mutated p53. We observed that ZYTIMA inhibited cell growth in H1299 cells, but the effects were significantly reduced in cells expressing wt p53 (Figure [3A](#F3){ref-type="fig"}). We also observed that in the presence of ZYTIMA, ZP005 is able to inhibit cell growth of cells with wt p53 more effectively than cells with mutated p53 (Figure [3B](#F3){ref-

Prompt:  Urethane is a drug that targets
 
Response: Urethane is a drug that targets a very specific enzyme in the brain called NOS. NOS is involved in the creation of a neurotransmitter called nitric oxide. The nitric oxide then goes on to create a chemical reaction in a receptor on a nearby cell. When this reaction happens, the cell changes shape and the cell is stimulated. This stimulates the cell to release a hormone called vasopressin, which causes the blood vessels to expand. This results in an erection. Urethane works by preventing the production of nitric oxide, thus preventing the blood vessels from expanding. This prevents the erection.

Some of the benefits of urethane are:

It works quickly. This makes it ideal for men who want to have sex right away.

Prompt:  uridine is a drug that targets
 
Response: uridine is a drug that targets only the G1 phase. Thus, it would be an interesting question to evaluate the effect of the two drugs on the G2/M transition in *P*. *berghei*-infected RBCs. The addition of roscovitine or thymidine to *P*. *berghei*-infected RBCs did not result in any significant changes in the cell cycle distribution, suggesting that *P*. *berghei* is not sensitive to these drugs at the concentrations used in our experiments (data not shown).

A number of proteins involved in cell cycle progression and regulation have been found to be involved in the cell cycle arrest of *P*. *berghei*-infected RBCs. One of the proteins involved in this process is the RB-E2F pathway. The RB-E2F pathway is a major regulator of the G1/S transition in mammalian cells \[[@ppat.

Prompt:  Uridine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Uridine is a drug that targets the aqueous humor of the eye. When the drug is injected into the eye, it travels through the blood to the anterior chamber, and then diffuses across the cornea and into the aqueous humor, where it binds to anionic sites on the ciliary epithelium. It is used to treat narrow angle glaucoma, a common form of glaucoma that causes narrowing of the angle of the eye. It is not approved for the treatment of open angle glaucoma.

Prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost, are a group of drugs that lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow. This mechanism works by allowing the aqueous humor to flow more easily through the uveoscleral outflow tract.

Prompt:  Voreloxin is a drug that targets
 
Response: Voreloxin is a drug that targets the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The receptor is part of a larger protein family that also includes HER2 and HER3. This receptor is involved in many biological processes such as cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is found in many cancers including breast, lung, colon, prostate, head and neck, and ovarian cancer. The drug binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor. Voreloxin causes the receptor to dimerize and activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This causes the receptor to become phosphorylated and activate downstream pathways that can cause cell death. It is not known whether the drug will be used as a single agent or in combination with other drugs.

Voreloxin is being developed by Pharmacyclics, Inc. and is being investigated in combination with the antibody cetuximab.

Prompt:  VX-809 is a drug that targets
 
Response: VX-809 is a drug that targets the mitochondrial function of POLG. The drug is a nucleoside analogue that reversibly binds to the enzyme's active site, thereby blocking the incorporation of nucleotides into the growing DNA chain. This results in a series of chain termination events, ultimately leading to reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and decreased mtDNA levels.

Treatment of human cells with VX-809 was first shown to have a profound effect on mtDNA levels in 2005.1 In vitro, VX-809 inhibited the proliferation of many cancer cell lines and caused the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations.2  It was later shown to have a strong cytotoxic effect on tumor cells in vivo, inhibiting the growth of xenografts in mice.3 VX-809 has also been shown to have a positive effect on mitochondrial function in patients with the mitochondrial disease Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).4

Prompt:  Xylitol is a drug that targets
 
Response: Xylitol is a drug that targets the bacterial metabolism of xylose. In contrast to the well-studied inhibition of the aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) in human tissue, little is known about the effect of xylitol on this enzyme in bacteria. In this study, xylitol was found to inhibit the xylose-reducing activity of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. This inhibition is due to a competition for binding to the enzyme and to a decrease in the activity of the enzyme. The inhibition was observed in the presence of either NADH or NADPH. However, the xylitol inhibition of the aldose reductase was only observed when NADPH was used as the cofactor. Xylitol is an inhibitor of aldose reductase in both the bacterial and the human enzyme.

Prompt:  Zanubrutinib is a drug that targets
 
Response: Zanubrutinib is a drug that targets the tyrosine kinase activity of Bruton\'s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BTK plays an important role in B cell development and is activated in CLL, where it functions to maintain the survival of malignant cells ([@B1]).

BTK inhibition leads to cell death and reduces tumor burden in CLL patients ([@B2], [@B3]). BTK inhibitors are effective in both treatment-naïve and relapsed CLL patients ([@B2]--[@B5]). Treatment-naïve patients are more likely to achieve a complete response and less likely to experience disease progression or death ([@B2]).

In addition to CLL, BTK inhibitors have been studied in a number of hematologic malignancies, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL

Prompt:  Zidovudine is a drug that targets
 
Response: Zidovudine is a drug that targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Zidovudine has been a mainstay in the treatment of HIV infections for many years. However, there is a need to improve the efficacy of this drug.
Reverse transcriptase is an essential enzyme of the life cycle of HIV. This enzyme is encoded by the pol gene and is responsible for the transcription of viral RNA into DNA. This enzyme also has a DNA polymerase activity which is important for the elongation of DNA.
Inhibition of reverse transcriptase can be achieved by blocking the enzyme in its active site. Inhibition of the enzyme in its active site prevents the production of infectious HIV.
Zidovudine is a nucleoside analogue of deoxycytidine. It is a purine nucleoside analogue and a potent inhibitor of reverse transcriptase. It is known as 3′-azido-3

Prompt:  ZOMIG is a drug that targets
 
Response: ZOMIG is a drug that targets the expression of a protein called Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). Plk1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in cancer cells. ZOMIG is a small molecule that binds to the Plk1 kinase domain and inhibits its activity.

After demonstrating in vitro that ZOMIG was capable of reducing the growth of human colon cancer cells in culture, researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Harvard Medical School (HMS) set out to test the drug in a mouse model of human colon cancer.

In the new study, researchers found that ZOMIG reduced the growth of colon cancer cells in mice, and extended the survival of mice that had colon cancer. The drug was also well-tolerated in mice. The findings were published today in the journal Cancer Cell.

"Our work is the first to show that Plk1
