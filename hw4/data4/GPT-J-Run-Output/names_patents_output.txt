Response: AY-27400 is a drug mentioned in patent application US2009/0197540 and approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. While its effectiveness is widely acknowledged, its mechanism of action is still under investigation. This review is focused on the interaction between NAs and cyclophilin A, a protein that has been identified as a target of some NAs. Cyclophilin A is a cellular protein with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds. Since this enzyme is also found in viral proteins, including the NS3 protease of HCV, the viral protein NS3/4A and the HCV non-structural 5A protein, cyclophilin A has been suggested to be a potential host factor involved in HCV infection. The interaction between cyclophilin

It is one of the so-called third generation type I CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been developed to inhibit CYP3A4 activity and, therefore, to prolong the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs which are metabolized by this cytochrome. AZD2014 is an indole derivative which has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of CYP3A4. It has a good pharmacokinetic profile in rats and dogs, but is only poorly absorbed after oral administration in humans. In order to obtain more favourable pharmacokinetic profiles, AZD2014 was synthesized and its effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and caffeine were studied in humans. The influence of AZD2014 on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus was also investigated. The results obtained show that the introduction of an N-substituent

Prompt:  AZD2932 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: AZD2932 is a drug mentioned in patent application US 2011/0224508 and in the article “ATP-sensitive potassium channel activators, including AZD2932, for the treatment of heart failure” by Anantharam V, Buchan C, Deeds R J, Gribble A M, Alford R J, Healy K P, Huggins C C, Zollars A C. Expert Opin Investig Drugs (2011) 20: 1365-1376. AZD2932 is a potent and selective activator of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel). It has been shown to exert cardio-protective effects in several animal models of cardiovascular disease and to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. The activity of AZD2932 is mediated through the opening of the KATP channel and results in the hyperpolarization of the myocardial membrane potential and a reduction in intracellular calcium levels

Prompt:  AZD3229 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: AZD3229 is a drug mentioned in patent US20140253787. This drug is also referred to as crizotinib. This drug is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and is approved for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it has been found that about 20% of patients treated with crizotinib do not respond to the treatment (Al-Batran et al., 2012). The main problem with crizotinib is that a significant number of patients who receive the drug do not respond to it. Moreover, the drug is associated with severe side effects. Thus, there is a need for a drug which is effective in treating ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, which does not have the side effects associated with crizotinib.

Response: AZD3759 is a drug mentioned in patent WO 01/04335 and its effects on fibroblasts are known.
A particular disadvantage of fibroblasts, as compared to epithelial cells, is that they are difficult to grow in culture. Although the technique of culturing fibroblasts is known, there are problems with this. In particular, fibroblasts have a high degree of variability in their growth rate and morphology.
It is known that the cell cycle of fibroblasts is relatively short. It has been estimated that fibroblasts in culture will only survive for 1 to 2 weeks.
In addition, it is known that cell growth is affected by the extracellular environment. For example, the size of fibroblasts grown in a medium with low glucose concentration is less than fibroblasts grown in a medium with a high glucose concentration.
Furthermore, it is known that cell growth and the cell cycle can be affected

Prompt:  Akti-1 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Akti-1 is a drug mentioned in patent literature for treating type 2 diabetes. It is currently marketed as Glumetza (AstraZeneca) in Europe and Takeda Pharmaceuticals (Celgene) in the United States. This drug is known to be useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including patients with hepatic dysfunction. It is an incretin mimetic that stimulates insulin secretion by increasing the amount of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreted by the L-cells of the intestine. This hormone is released from the L-cells of the intestine when glucose levels in the blood are elevated. This drug acts by stimulating GLP-1 secretion.

The action of GLP-1 on the pancreas is similar to the action of insulin, and thus GLP-1-based drugs can be used in combination with insulin to achieve more complete control of glucose levels.

Response: Amygdalin is a drug mentioned in patent applications US 2010/0275926 and WO 2010/007020.

The human body has a defence mechanism to prevent pathogens from infecting the body. This mechanism is known as the immune system. It can be activated by pathogens or a virus entering the body. The body's response to an infection is the production of immune cells, such as macrophages, which will engulf the pathogen or virus. The immune cells will release enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill the pathogen or virus.

The immune system can also be activated by the presence of amyloid. Amyloid can be found in various forms in the body. The most common type is amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaques are found in the brain, but can also be found in other organs such as the heart and the kidneys. Amyloid plaques consist of a protein called amyloid beta. This

Prompt:  Amylmetacresol is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Amylmetacresol is a drug mentioned in patent CN1301237C, which discloses a process for preparing this compound. According to the process described in the patent, the amylmetacresol is prepared by reducing phenyl acetylaldehyde in a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and hydrochloric acid in the presence of zinc. The main drawbacks of this process are the use of a large amount of DMSO and the need to recover the zinc in the final step. The use of a large amount of DMSO is a problem because this solvent is not water-soluble and can have negative effects on the quality of the product.

The objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing amylmetacresol that uses a smaller amount of DMSO and does not require the use of a catalyst or a special reactor, and thus does not have the drawbacks of the processes described in the prior art

Response: Atglistatin is a drug mentioned in patent US2006/0235738. It is described as a competitive inhibitor of the serine hydrolase of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (Kishore et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2006, 281: 16562-16572). Adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the first step in triglyceride hydrolysis in adipocytes and hepatocytes. The latter is an important site of lipolysis in the post-prandial state, releasing fatty acids to be oxidized in the liver. This pathway is of particular importance in insulin resistant states. This inhibition of ATGL is believed to promote fat accumulation in adipose tissue and contribute to insulin resistance (Nordlie, Diabetologia 2008, 51: 2037-2045). The inhibitor may also be useful for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes (Al

Prompt:  BAM is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: BAM is a drug mentioned in patent literature 1 and 2, and there are many reports on the pharmacological effects of BAM on osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and the like. However, the effects of BAM on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have not been elucidated at all.

MSCs are multipotent cells that can be obtained from bone marrow, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, and the like, and can be expanded to obtain large numbers in culture. Because MSCs have a high proliferation rate and are capable of differentiating into cells of mesenchymal tissues such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and the like, MSCs are expected to be useful for the regeneration of bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue, and have attracted attention as a new type of stem cell (Non-Patent Literature 1). However, it is difficult to use MSCs in regener

Response: BAW2881 is a drug mentioned in patent literature and there are some literature on its research and development. Patent literature CN104799676A discloses a class of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound and their use in treating and preventing inflammation, tumors and other disorders. The structure of the compound is shown in formula (I).

A specific compound in formula (I) is known as NK-2 receptor antagonist, namely BAYu3402. In 2012, the drug was tested in a phase II clinical trial for treatment of arthritis, and the result was not encouraging (Chinese Patent Application CN201210483063.9). The activity of the drug may be due to the anti-inflammatory effect and the selective antagonistic effect on the NK-2 receptor. The NK-2 receptor is expressed in the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems, and its role is to regulate the smooth muscle contraction and the production of inflammatory mediators.

Prompt:  BAY is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: BAY is a drug mentioned in patent literature as an anti-obesity drug. It has been suggested that one of the mechanisms of action of BAY in this regard is that it suppresses appetite. There is one clinical trial published, however, which suggests that BAY may have an effect on appetite and food intake. The trial compared BAY with a placebo and found that there was a significant decrease in the percentage of body fat in those patients who received BAY, but no change in body weight in the placebo group.
There are other mechanisms of action for BAY in addition to appetite suppression. These mechanisms include:                i) Modulation of leptin expression.        ii) Suppression of ghrelin expression.        iii) Inhibition of fat cell differentiation.        iv) Inhibition of food intake and increase in energy

Response: Bendamustine is a drug mentioned in patent application EP-A-0 354 872 and marketed by Biomedics AG, Wien, Austria. The following formula represents the structure of bendamustine:

Bendamustine is an alkylating agent which can be used in the treatment of haematological diseases and solid tumours. The mechanism of action of bendamustine is based on the covalent binding of its alkylating nitrogen mustard group to DNA. This reaction causes the formation of a bendamustine-DNA adduct, which, after excision of the drug, blocks DNA synthesis and leads to cell death. Bendamustine is a semisynthetic derivative of the natural alkaloid cytarabine (ara-C). Cytarabine is a deoxycytidine analogue and is a structural isomer of arabinosylcytosine.

It is described in the literature that when the sodium level in the blood is reduced, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, and this is considered to be the primary mechanism for the use of diuretics to treat congestive heart failure. It is also known that when the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, a patient with congestive heart failure may have symptoms that are not related to the blood volume, such as dyspnea.

Prompt:  CB-839 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CB-839 is a drug mentioned in patent applications WO2010/067261 and WO2010/067262. These documents claim new compounds that act as modulators of the MMP-2 enzyme. However, CB-839 is not a very potent inhibitor of MMP-2.
Other MMP inhibitors, such as ONO-4817, have been developed. These inhibitors are designed to be orally active, and therefore they can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions. However, ONO-4817 is an antifibrotic drug, and thus, it has the potential to cause side effects in patients. For example, the drug is a potent inhibitor of MMP-9, and thus, it has the potential to cause side effects associated with an inhibition of MMP-9.
There is a need for additional compounds that are useful as MMP inhibitors. The present invention provides such compounds. These compounds are useful as therapeutic agents

Prompt:  CC-930 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CC-930 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2004028502. This drug is an anticancer agent and inhibits a human 5-lipoxygenase, a kind of protein involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. This drug is used to treat various diseases including asthma, psoriasis, and cancer.
One of the adverse effects of CC-930 is myelosuppression. It is thought that this side effect is caused by the inhibition of a 5-lipoxygenase that is necessary for the production of inflammatory mediators in leukocytes, since the effect of the drug can be blocked by the co-administration of a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.
The other adverse effect of CC-930 is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is known that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors have the property of scavenging ROS and the co-administration of a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with CC-930 could

Prompt:  CFSE is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CFSE is a drug mentioned in patent EP 0 316 282 B1 (EP 0 672 635 A1). It is a fluorochrome, which, when introduced into cells, remains bound to the cell membrane for several days. By staining cells with the fluorescent dye CFSE, it is possible to follow cell division and to distinguish between daughter cells. This makes it possible to count cells that have undergone cell division and to distinguish between the number of cells in each generation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the drug on cell proliferation in vivo in two murine tumor models: Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) and murine melanoma B16. It was found that the number of 3LL and B16 cells was significantly reduced in animals treated with CFSE. In addition, the number of dead cells was also reduced in the CFSE-treated group.

HCT is an anion channel activated by hypoxia. It was found to be activated by CO and anesthetics (e.g., halothane and isoflurane). HCT is activated by many chemical toxins, including cyanide, azide, acetylcholine, ATP, GTP, serotonin, histamine, prostaglandin E2, phorbol ester, and p-aminobenzoic acid. These chemicals all activate the receptor-gated cation channel. Activation of the HCT by these chemicals leads to increased cell permeability to Na+ and K+ ions, leading to cell swelling. It is hypothesized that the increase in cell volume in response to these chemicals causes the opening of the HCT. HCT has been proposed to play a role in many pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, inflammation, and apoptosis

Prompt:  CL-183319 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CL-183319 is a drug mentioned in patent EP 1,532,250 and was identified as a highly potent inhibitor of PDE10. In order to identify further compounds that have PDE10 inhibitory activity, we have designed a primary high throughput screen (HTS) of an in-house compound library and optimized it using the Enamine screening platform. The assay is based on the determination of intracellular cAMP levels in the presence of various concentrations of the compound. The IC50 values obtained for the PDE10 inhibitor were consistent with the previously published data. The cAMP accumulation assay was used as a confirmation assay to confirm the PDE10 inhibitory activity of the hits obtained in the primary screen. In the secondary screen, the active compounds were tested in a cell-based PDE10-Glo assay. This assay uses a coupled luminescent enzyme immunoassay, in which the production of light is directly proportional to the amount of PDE10

SensiMouse

Bioluminescence imaging of T cell function in mouse models of cancer is now a standard method for the investigation of T cell responses to tumor antigens. One of the limitations of this approach is the difficulty of obtaining tumor-specific T cells from mice. Here we report the generation of a novel transgenic mouse strain, called SensiMouse, in which T cells specific for a defined model antigen are isolated from mice expressing an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter. This strain can be used to study T cell responses in vivo to a wide range of antigens and can be adapted for a wide range of studies including adoptive transfer of T cells, in vivo imaging of T cell migration and the assessment of tumor responses in vivo.

Prompt:  CL-260142 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CL-260142 is a drug mentioned in patent US2007/0182842, which is used for the treatment of myocardial infarction. Although there are a lot of papers about this drug, the research on its pharmacological action mechanism is still in the exploratory stage. In the present study, we used a cellular calcium ion imaging system to study the effect of the drug on calcium ion homeostasis in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. We found that CL-260142 promoted the intracellular calcium ion concentration to increase, which was accompanied by the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium uptake. The CL-260142-induced intracellular calcium ion increase was inhibited by nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker. This suggests that the CL-260142-induced intracellular calcium ion increase was mainly due to the inhibition of SR calcium uptake. This is the first report to show the effect of CL-

Response: CL-28786 is a drug mentioned in patent EP2348750. However, the two drugs are not chemically related. This may explain the observation that A771726 has an effect in a variety of cancers and is less toxic than BIBF 1120.

In conclusion, this study shows that the EGFR inhibitor A771726 induces apoptosis and autophagy in glioblastoma cell lines and enhances the effect of TMZ, an alkylating agent commonly used in the treatment of GBM. Further studies are required to better understand the role of autophagy in the response to A771726. However, the data obtained in this study, combined with the ability of A771726 to cross the blood--brain barrier \[[@B15-ijms-21-03987]\], support the use of this drug in the treatment of GBM.

Response: CL-292468 is a drug mentioned in patent application WO 2012/096675 A2. It has the following structure:

The present invention is concerned with novel compounds which are modulators of the CX3CR1 receptor, in particular they are modulators of the CX3CR1 receptor which are useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by CX3CR1 receptors.
There is a growing body of evidence that CX3CR1 is an important player in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. It is believed that CX3CR1 is involved in both the innate and adaptive immune system. CX3CR1 has been shown to play a role in macrophage activation and phagocytosis (Ziegler et al., Nature (2006) 442, 63-68), neutrophil chemotaxis (Cherian et al., J. Immunol. (2007) 178, 4934-4941

Response: CL-292483 is a drug mentioned in patent WO 2013/123493. The structures of CL-292483 and its metabolites are depicted in FIG. 2 of this patent application.

The (S)- and (R)-enantiomers of CL-292483 have been shown to be pharmacologically active (WO 2013/123493), however the separation of the enantiomers is challenging. CL-292483 is commercially available in the (S)-enantiomer form.
The (S)-enantiomer is a potent and selective inhibitor of the CCR9 receptor (Ki of 0.3 nM), and the (R)-enantiomer has only moderate potency against CCR9 (Ki of 18 nM). The (S)-enantiomer of CL-292483 is therefore a more desirable starting material for the preparation of CCR9 inhibitors.

Clinical studies have shown that anemia is common in patients with advanced cancer. Several mechanisms may underlie the cancer-related anemia, including: (1) increased bone marrow erythropoiesis; (2) reduced production of EPO; (3) impaired iron metabolism; (4) increased hepcidin synthesis; and (5) reduced EPO sensitivity in the bone marrow.
It has been shown that cancer patients with anemia respond to EPO and its analogues in a similar way to non-cancer patients. For example, EPO and its analogues are effective in the treatment of anemia in patients with non-cancer related conditions, such as chronic renal failure, congenital EPO deficiency, hereditary or acquired EPO resistance, and autoimmune disorders. However, the response to EPO and

Response: CL-337438 is a drug mentioned in patent WO/2010/085241. The full-length amino acid sequence of TAT is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. TAT, a hydrophobic peptide with a length of 48 amino acids, is a drug used to transport an enzyme to the nucleus of a cell. This enzyme, cytochrome c, is able to bind to the cytoplasm of the mitochondria and then move to the cytoplasm of the nucleus, where it can trigger the cell death. The ability of TAT to enter the cell depends on the NLS of the sequence. The authors found that the efficiency of the delivery of the cytochrome c enzyme to the nucleus of the cell increases with the increase in the number of positive charges in the sequence.
TAT was approved by the FDA in 1994 as a carrier of the enzyme cytochrome c. This enzyme is toxic for cancer cells and, therefore

Prompt:  CL-401096 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: CL-401096 is a drug mentioned in patent applications of several companies and has been used in clinical trials for over two decades. Its mechanisms of action include potent anti-angiogenic activity, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. However, the clinical development of CL-401096 was terminated because of its poor solubility and limited oral bioavailability. Recently, we have shown that CL-401096 forms a water-soluble complex with pyridine-2,4,6-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA), which is an anionic aromatic compound with a very high solubility in water. CL-401096 and PTCA formed a water-soluble complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and the molecular size of the complex was found to be 15-16 nm. The molecular structure of the complex was confirmed by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

Cyclosporin A is an immunosuppressant that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (see, for example, Glick et al., Lancet, 355:2041-2047 (2000); and Mallett et al., Ann. Rheum. Dis., 60:105-111 (2001)). Its therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials. However, the drug suffers from a variety of side effects, including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. It is therefore desirable to identify new cyclosporin derivatives with improved therapeutic properties.

Response: CL-421120 is a drug mentioned in patent WO/2011/070913. However, the compound has not been described in the patent document, and there is no experimental data of CL-421120 available in the literature. Therefore, the description of CL-421120 in WO/2011/070913 is not convincing. The patent document claims that CL-421120 has a pharmaceutical effect of inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. The applicant of the patent document used the compound CL-421120 to treat LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mice, but no further description of CL-421120 is given in the patent document. Therefore, it is not convincing that CL-421120 is a new compound, and it is impossible to prove the existence of the compound CL-421120.

In summary, based on the above results, we have proven that CL-421120 is a novel compound, and the compound

Response: CL-425073 is a drug mentioned in patent US20120054708 which is used to treat type 2 diabetes. This drug is a lipophilic, cationic amphiphilic, peptide which induces a potent insulinotropic effect and enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo in humans. Its insulinotropic effect is thought to be mediated by a dual mechanism: (i) an increase in calcium concentration in the cytoplasm of beta-cells and (ii) an increase in the glucose-induced ATP/ADP ratio, which stimulates insulin exocytosis. CL-425073 also improves glucose tolerance in diabetic patients and has been shown to improve the clinical outcome in animal models of diabetes. In clinical trials, CL-425073 has been shown to have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism, and it is under investigation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Response: CL-505349 is a drug mentioned in patent applications, and its mechanism of action and side effects are not yet known. The goal of this study was to develop a PBPK model to describe the pharmacokinetics of CL-505349 and to investigate the impact of food on CL-505349 absorption. The PBPK model was developed by combining the mechanistic absorption and distribution model (ADAM) with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CL-505349. Food effect was incorporated into the model by using the PBPK model to describe the impact of food on CL-505349 absorption. The CL-505349 PBPK model was evaluated by simulating CL-505349 plasma concentration-time profiles following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg in fed and fasted states. Food effect was found to increase CL-505349 absorption rate, leading to a delayed time to peak concentration and a shortened half-life. Food

2. Background Information

2.1. Cyclin-Dependent Kinases

The proliferation of normal cells is tightly controlled by an intracellular signaling cascade that is triggered when extracellular growth signals bind to cell surface receptors. This cascade is comprised of several protein kinases that are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and small GTPases. The activated protein kinases phosphorylate and activate downstream signaling proteins that ultimately lead to cell cycle progression, proliferation and differentiation.

One of the protein kinases in this cascade is the serine/threonine kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). CDKs are the catalytic components of a family of ser

Prompt:  Chloroambucil is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Chloroambucil is a drug mentioned in patent US561418A for treatment of cancer. Its activity is based on its ability to form a DNA cross-link, a lesion that is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Although a cross-link formed in the presence of a DNA polymerase has the same effect as a cross-link formed by irradiation, the cross-link formed in the presence of a DNA polymerase can be removed by the polymerase. In this way, chloroambucil is a good agent for sensitizing cells to a killing agent that works by the same mechanism. However, the in vivo efficacy of chloroambucil is poor.
A major factor contributing to the low efficacy of chloroambucil is the presence of metabolizing enzymes that can remove the drug from the cell before it has the opportunity to form the DNA cross-link. This problem can be addressed by administering the drug in a lipos

Prompt:  DCC-2618 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: DCC-2618 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2008027131 which was granted to a company called Astellas in 2005. It was developed for treating type 2 diabetes. In October 2010, it was approved for use in the US.

The company claims that DCC-2618 is a new chemical entity which lowers blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients.

Pharmacology

Mechanism of action
DCC-2618 works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), a phosphodiesterase enzyme which is expressed in immune cells and has a key role in their activation. This action inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators which are involved in the immune response, and thereby reduces inflammation.

PDE4 inhibitors such as DCC-2618 are believed to work by improving the insulin response to glucose in type 2 diabetes patients.

DCC-2618 has been shown to improve glucose

How the world of HIV-1 and AIDS has changed since the start of the epidemic in the 1980s.

Background

HIV-1 infection has been a major public health concern for decades. The current standard of care for people living with HIV-1 is the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which consists of a combination of three or more antiretroviral drugs. However, since HAART was first approved, several challenges have been faced. New drug-resistant viruses have emerged, especially the viral strain that has become dominant in the population, the highly pathogenic HIV-1 strain. There is also a need for an effective HIV-1 vaccine, and the search for a cure has become a focus of interest.

Prompt:  Dicoumarol is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Dicoumarol is a drug mentioned in patent US4320486 A1. This patent claims an inhibition of the thrombin induced platelet aggregation. The description of the compound is as follows: 
Thrombin, the most potent activator of platelets, has a key role in the formation of arterial thrombi. This activity of thrombin is achieved through activation of platelets by a complex formation of thrombin with thrombomodulin, which results in cleavage of thrombomodulin and binding of the resultant peptide, termed a thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), to the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib.
This interaction of TAFI with platelet GPIb initiates a signalling cascade that leads to activation of platelets. TAFI has a molecular weight of approximately 18 kDa and contains two Kunitz domains, a region found in a variety of proteins

Response: E-64 is a drug mentioned in patent number WO2005/014864 A2 and in a number of scientific papers. It is used as an anti-cancer drug, but also as an antiviral agent, an immunosuppressant, an anti-hypertensive agent and an agent to reduce or eliminate pain.
The most important pharmaceutical route of administration of E-64 is the oral route, because it is the most convenient for patients. However, in the oral route, the compound E-64 has a low bioavailability, and therefore the doses are very high, and this has negative side effects, and in some cases, there are even undesirable effects. Therefore, a good alternative would be an intravenous route, because the bioavailability would be much higher, and the dose would be much lower, and thus the side effects would be much lower. However, in the case of the intravenous route, it is important that the compound is stable in solution.

Prompt:  ENMD-2076 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: ENMD-2076 is a drug mentioned in patent applications and drug publications. However, there is no published report that provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between drug structure and its ADME profile. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive study of the ADME profiles of three potential drugs from a literature search. Our findings demonstrated that the ADME profiles of the three drugs were remarkably similar, despite their differences in their structures and functions. Furthermore, we also found that the three drugs had similar pharmacokinetic properties and similar drug-drug interactions. Thus, our findings support the notion that drug structure is not the only factor that determines drug ADME profiles.

1. Diabetic complications

The relationship between high blood glucose levels and diabetic complications is well established. Many theories have been put forward to explain the causal mechanism. The most accepted explanation is the "sugar hypothesis", which suggests that hyperglycemia is the cause of many complications in diabetes. The two major theories explaining the sugar hypothesis are the oxidative stress theory and the advanced glycation end-product (AGE) hypothesis. According to the oxidative stress theory, the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the vascular, neurological and renal complications observed in diabetes. According to the AGE hypothesis, a large number of non-enzymatic chemical reactions, collectively known as the Maillard reaction, occur in vivo, in the presence of glucose, proteins,

"What we've found is that in some cancers, the cells that die when the drug is given are cancer stem cells," says Lawrence Chan, a biochemist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. "The fact that these are very rare cells, it's good to find a way to target them."

Chan notes that the new study also helps address an important question. Although the breast cancer stem cells have been identified in a laboratory setting, it's not clear if they exist in humans.

"They've shown they exist in breast cancer, but it's not clear if they are the only population," Chan says. "It's also not clear how important they are, because the other populations of cells are the ones that are dividing and causing the tumor to grow."

Response: Famciclovir is a drug mentioned in patent WO 2008/081099. It is a nucleoside analogue, also known as 2′-deoxy-2′-fluorocytidine, which has been developed for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. The compound is currently marketed under the trade name Famvir™.
Famciclovir is currently marketed in oral solution form. This form has the disadvantage that it requires administration of a higher volume of solution to achieve a comparable exposure to the blood level as compared to the exposure achieved by a higher oral dose of the drug. This means that the oral dose is administered in higher volumes of solution, which in turn leads to more frequent administration and increased cost of treatment.
There is thus a need for a convenient dosage form for the administration of Famciclovir that will provide a therapeutically effective exposure to the blood level of the drug.

Prompt:  Finasteride is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Finasteride is a drug mentioned in patent US4046608A1 and is the generic of Finasteride (5α-reductase inhibitor). Finasteride is the most prescribed 5α-reductase inhibitor for androgenic alopecia and it has the potential to cause cancer, especially breast cancer. Several studies suggest that the male and female breasts can be affected by finasteride, even in doses considered safe. Breast cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease, with different morphological subtypes, with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Although many risk factors have been described, it is still unknown what factors increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Finasteride can cause breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Breast cancer may occur in women receiving finasteride for alopecia, for sex hormone-related disorders or for other medical conditions. The treatment of breast cancer in women is different from the treatment of the disease in men

Prompt:  Formestane is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Formestane is a drug mentioned in patent WO 96/10018 and marketed by Wyeth as a product that reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. The drug is a synthetic steroidal estrane derivative which is a member of a family of compounds called aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are synthetic compounds that block the conversion of androgens to estrogens by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. Inhibiting the aromatase enzyme reduces the formation of estrogen and thus prevents the stimulation of estrogen receptors in breast tissue.
The estrogen receptors in the breast tissue are in high concentration in the epithelial cells of the breast. It is thought that the stimulation of estrogen receptors in the breast tissue results in a proliferation of the epithelial cells in the breast. It is known that the breast cancer cells contain estrogen receptors and that the presence of estrogen receptors in the breast tissue is an indicator of breast cancer. Thus, inhibiting the aromatase enzyme prevents the stimulation of the estrogen

Background

[0116]

The protein kinase PI3K is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a p110 catalytic subunit and an adapter subunit. PI3K is activated when its adapter subunit binds to a receptor tyrosine kinase or G-protein coupled receptor. The catalytic subunit of PI3K phosphorylates the 3′-OH group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol. This in turn generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinosit

Prompt:  G150 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: G150 is a drug mentioned in patent applications for the treatment of diabetes and cancer. Here, we report the pharmacological properties of G150 and its two main metabolites, G153 and G148. Both G150 and its metabolites are full agonists of the human GLP-1 receptor and G153 is also a partial agonist. However, unlike G150, G153 does not induce β-cell proliferation. In contrast, G148 and G153 induced both cell proliferation and β-cell neogenesis in vitro. These data suggest that G150 is an agonist that induces β-cell proliferation and differentiation, while G153 is an agonist that induces β-cell neogenesis.

GNT is a naturally occurring, sulfur-containing glycosylated polypeptide that is released from activated platelets and contains glycosylated and nonglycosylated subunits, each with approximately 80 kDa. GNT acts as a co-factor for thrombin, thereby stimulating platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. GNT is a potent inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and is thought to be the physiological inhibitor of platelet aggregation.

GNT was first identified in 1977 by Moskowitz and coworkers as a product released from platelets activated by ADP. See Moskowitz et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1977) 252:7291-7295. This discovery was followed by the discovery of a number of GNT

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

The development of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of bacterial infections, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, is a very important field in the fight against the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.

The identification of new antibacterial drugs is a continuous process, with new molecules being discovered every year. In recent years, a new class of antibiotics has been developed, called the diazabicyclooctanes (DBOs). DBOs are analogues of the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and azithromycin \[[@CR1]\].

DBOs are compounds that present a large spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Prompt:  GI-558728 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: GI-558728 is a drug mentioned in patent applications that are currently being reviewed. In addition, there are other drugs currently in Phase I and II of clinical trials for various conditions including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, sarcoglycanopathies, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. These clinical trials have shown positive results in the target population. However, there are limitations to the clinical trials as they are all performed in single center studies. Thus, the possibility of obtaining the same positive results in a large scale clinical trial is not assured. The main reason for this lack of success is the low penetration of these drugs into the muscle tissue, as they are produced and delivered in the bloodstream.

The delivery of these drugs to muscle tissue could be improved by delivering the drug directly to the muscle tissue. This delivery can be accomplished by attaching the drug to a protein carrier that would be injected directly into the muscle tissue. These protein carriers can be designed to be highly

Prompt:  GI-559026 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: GI-559026 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2004/046955 and the active ingredient of this drug is desipramine. Desipramine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and has anti-depressive effects. This drug is currently on the market in China. The content of desipramine in the oral solution of GI-559026 is 6.8 mg/ml, and its pH value is 4.8. It is reported in the patent application that the effect of this drug can be enhanced by increasing the concentration of desipramine in the solution.
However, the acidity of GI-559026 is still high, and it can cause a bad taste. The high concentration of desipramine is likely to increase the risk of drug abuse. It is thus difficult to promote the use of GI-559026 in clinical practice.

Response: GI-566033 is a drug mentioned in patent WO 2011/032826. However, the experimental results presented in the patent are for the complex with sodium didecyl sulfate, not with potassium didecyl sulfate. The difference between the sodium and potassium salts of the compound is that the potassium salt is used as an anti-allergic agent. The anti-allergic activity of the compound is based on its ability to bind to IgE, and therefore the potassium salt is a less suitable compound for use as an anti-allergic agent. The sodium salt is a more suitable compound for use as an anti-allergic agent.

Response: GI-568122 is a drug mentioned in patent applications, which claims the ability to block IKr channels. However, no functional data are reported in the patent, so the IC50 values were not derived. On the contrary, the functional effect of TGI-568122 was demonstrated on native (from guinea pig ventricular myocytes) IKr channels, which are strongly blocked by E-4031 (IC50=12 nM). However, the same compound was reported to be ineffective on the human IKr channel expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293 cells). Thus, the present study has been designed to further investigate the ability of TGI-568122 to block IKr channels. The results obtained in HEK-293 cells expressing the human IKr channel were similar to those reported for native IKr channels: the concentration-response curves for the drug were fitted by a sigmoidal function and the calculated IC50 value was 16

This was shown to induce the phosphorylation of GSK3β target proteins such as glycogen synthase (GS), cyclin D1, C-Raf, Akt and Bad. These results led to the identification of GSK3β as a promising target for the development of new anticancer drugs. In this context, it was found that GSK2983559 induced G1 cell cycle arrest in human lung cancer cells by phosphorylating CDK2, which resulted in inhibition of its kinase activity.

Prompt:  GSK650394 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: GSK650394 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2014024758 and used in several clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of GSK650394 on a series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines and primary CLL cells. GSK650394 significantly inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in all tested CLL cell lines, with an IC50 ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 µM. GSK650394 induced apoptosis in CLL cells, and this effect was mediated by the activation of the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. Moreover, GSK650394 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our findings suggest that GSK650394 is a potential novel drug for the treatment of CLL.

Prompt:  GW2580 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: GW2580 is a drug mentioned in patent applications that claim to target the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) to treat various diseases, including cancer. While this approach has been suggested as a possible way to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol, no one has actually shown that this approach actually works.

The last few years have seen a dramatic increase in interest in the potential role of cholesterol in cancer. A number of studies have shown that cells with low cholesterol are more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. In one study, the response to radiation of lung cancer cells was found to be modulated by the amount of cholesterol in the cell. It is well known that cancer cells require a high rate of cholesterol synthesis to maintain rapid growth, but until recently no one had shown that cholesterol is required for cancer cell survival.

What is new is the claim that an inhibitor of HMGR, a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme

Background

MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system which is characterized by demyelination of the brain and spinal cord, leading to impairment of brain and nerve function.

MS is considered to be an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the myelin sheath, the protective covering of nerve fibers. This process damages nerve fibers, and can result in multiple areas of the central nervous system being affected. The disease is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 40.

The cause of MS is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by a combination of factors, including genetics, environment and viruses. There is no known cure for MS, but various treatments can be used

In contrast to the frequently used therapeutic agents like ampicillin, which are often administered parenterally, oral administration of β-lactam antibiotics leads to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation, followed by an enterohepatic circulation, and this results in the presence of the antibiotic in the systemic circulation for a longer time than when the drug is administered intravenously. Consequently, oral administration of β-lactam antibiotics is frequently associated with a relatively low serum drug concentration and requires a higher dosage than that administered parenterally. In addition, oral administration of β-lactam antibiotics is associated with the problem of microbial resistance and the possibility of development of bacterial resistance to the drug. In order to solve these problems, it is essential to develop new oral β-lactam antibiotics with a high bio

Response: IDO-IN-1 is a drug mentioned in patent literature and has been in Phase III trials.

The structures of these drugs are shown in [Figure 1](#f1-jir-9-175){ref-type="fig"}. They all share the same mechanism of action: they are protease inhibitors and have been developed for the treatment of HIV infection. It is interesting to note that, unlike all the other approved HIV protease inhibitors, they do not contain an HIV protease binding domain (eg, aspartic acid residues). Instead, they all have an alanine at the P1 position. This position is important in protease recognition and specificity, so this modification is thought to prevent the development of drug resistance. It is also possible that these inhibitors are not effective against some protease variants. This is supported by the observation that, in the case of some of these drugs, resistance can emerge after prolonged treatment, which could be due to a change

The current inventors have prepared INF39 for the first time, and demonstrated its anti-cancer activity in mice and non-human primates (see Patent Document 1). The inventors also demonstrated that INF39 has no toxicity to animals, including human, and is unlikely to cause an immunological reaction in human, when it is used in the form of an aqueous solution.
However, it is difficult to obtain INF39 by preparing the compound in a laboratory scale. Therefore, INF39 has not been put to practical use yet.

Response: IOX1 is a drug mentioned in patent application WO/2008/096435.

It is one of the latest additions to the group of “anti-inflammatory” drugs. Its mode of action is based on the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme (COX-1), which leads to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins, which in turn, cause a reduction in pain.

Some of the currently available anti-inflammatory drugs have a number of serious side effects, such as gastric ulcers, dyspepsia, diarrhea, heartburn, dizziness, and skin and blood vessel problems. Therefore, the development of drugs that do not have such side effects is of great interest.

Clinical studies show that certain compounds belonging to the family of the NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used for the treatment of arthritis, but they are not suitable for the treatment of the

Prompt:  IOX4 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: IOX4 is a drug mentioned in patent applications for its use as a potential treatment for ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate the mechanism of its neuroprotective activity, we tested the effects of neuroprotective concentrations of this compound in rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) to mimic a "physiological" environment. In these conditions, only 25% of slices were protected against OGD-induced damage. The protective effect of H(2)O(2) was mimicked by oxamate, a non-specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In contrast, oxamate had no effect in control slices. Oxygen-glucose deprivation also induced a small, but significant, decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity, which was not affected by the presence of oxamate. Thus

JZL184 is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor (Zamanillo et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 487, 3-8, 2004). In the hippocampus, the NMDA receptor is activated by the binding of glutamate to the NR2A and NR2B subunits. This results in the opening of the ion channel and the influx of calcium, which triggers a cascade of events leading to neuronal death. JZL184 was shown to block the glutamate-induced currents in primary hippocampal cultures and the cortical neurons (Zamanillo et al., supra). Furthermore, JZL184 protected cortical neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in vitro (Zamanillo et al., supra).

Response: KHS101 is a drug mentioned in patent applications and published scientific literature for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The FDA has not approved it for that use. Its mechanism of action is not well understood.

KHS101 has also been tested in several phase 2 trials for a number of other indications, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, anxiety, pain, and epilepsy. The most promising of these was a small trial in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. The trial showed that patients who received KHS101 in addition to an SSRI (an antidepressant that works by blocking the neurotransmitter serotonin) were much more likely to respond to treatment than those who received the SSRI alone. The results of this trial are encouraging, but it was a small trial and it is not known whether KHS101 is a safe and effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder.

Response: L755507 is a drug mentioned in patent applications WO2009/113685 and WO2008/076296.

Tyrphostins are inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase family. They act by binding to the ATP-binding site of tyrosine kinases, thereby blocking their catalytic activity and leading to inhibition of proliferation and cell survival.

The tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR2 is crucial for the activation of endothelial cells, and consequently, for angiogenesis.

Tyrphostins therefore have potential anti-cancer properties.

A study has been carried out to assess the anti-tumour properties of tyrphostins in combination with cisplatin.

Prompt:  LM-3872 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: LM-3872 is a drug mentioned in patent US20050020245 and which is believed to be in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of malaria. This compound is a tetrahydroquinoline, a series of which has been disclosed in WO98/09120. The tetrahydroquinoline compounds disclosed in this application have excellent pharmacokinetic properties and are orally bioavailable. The mechanism of action of these compounds is believed to involve the inhibition of hemozoin formation and thereby their activity in malaria is believed to be by the direct inhibition of the malaria parasite.
One of the drawbacks of these tetrahydroquinoline compounds is that they are believed to be unable to cross the blood brain barrier and thus their activity against malaria is limited to the peripheral blood. Thus the present invention provides a means of delivering the tetrahydroquinoline compounds to the central nervous system (CNS) and thereby provide better anti-malarial activity.

Prompt:  LY2584702 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: LY2584702 is a drug mentioned in patent documents that are available to the public and has been studied in some clinical trials. It is not approved for use in the United States, however. It is a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor that works by decreasing glycogenolysis and increasing glycogen synthesis. Glycogen is the main form of carbohydrate stored in cells. Its primary function is to provide glucose to muscles during times of intense physical activity. When you eat carbohydrate, it is converted to glycogen in the liver. Glycogen is then stored in muscles and is the primary fuel for physical activity. When the body needs energy, it breaks down glycogen. Glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. Inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase results in the accumulation of glycogen, which is then stored as glycogen in the liver. When the body needs energy, it converts glycogen to glucose and releases it

Prompt:  Leucomalachite is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Leucomalachite is a drug mentioned in patent documents, however its efficacy is not discussed. It is an orally active inhibitor of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Here, we discuss the patent documents and preclinical data on the efficacy of leucomalachite in several mitochondrial disorders. We found that leucomalachite has a very short half-life in humans and is very rapidly converted to leucovorin. In a rat model of Leigh syndrome, leucomalachite was not effective in decreasing mitochondrial DNA deletions. In mice, leucomalachite significantly decreased the accumulation of the mitochondrial DNA deletion associated with human chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, as well as ameliorated the behavioral and motor phenotype. Our findings support the idea that leucomalachite is a very poor inhibitor of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly and its effect is very limited.

Prompt:  Lonidamine is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Lonidamine is a drug mentioned in patent WO 91/15589, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. Lonidamine is a non-specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is able to block the activity of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase. Lonidamine has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumour cells in vitro and to increase the life span of animals bearing transplanted tumours. Lonidamine is also a potent inhibitor of the growth of cells in vitro and has shown good activity in clinical trials in humans.
The mechanism of action of lonidamine is still not fully understood, but the drug is thought to interfere with cellular energy metabolism and may induce apoptosis. The drug is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and induces a block in the mitochondrial electron transport system at the level of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain.

Prompt:  Loperamide is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Loperamide is a drug mentioned in patent applications and published literature that describes the use of loperamide in the treatment of diarrhea. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,314,081 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,430. These references indicate that the compound has a dual mechanism of action, the first being a reduction in intestinal fluid secretion, and the second being an anti-inflammatory action. However, these references also indicate that loperamide has poor oral bioavailability. In the early literature, U.S. Pat. No. 4,314,081 indicates that loperamide is not orally active and that its usefulness as a medicament for the treatment of diarrhea is limited to topical application. The '430 patent indicates that loperamide has low bioavailability, and indicates that loperamide has been administered intravenously to treat diarrhea in a human patient.
In view of the foregoing, it is apparent

Prompt:  Lornoxicam is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Lornoxicam is a drug mentioned in patent \#WO/2001/082726, which belongs to the group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Lornoxicam has been known for a long time as a NSAID, but its mode of action is quite different from that of the classical NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen, and naproxen). Lornoxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, which leads to a reduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) levels in the body. It is also known that the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) is reduced. The reduction of prostaglandins leads to the reduction of inflammation.
Lornoxicam has been developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and was launched on the market in 2001

Prompt:  Lubiprostone is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Lubiprostone is a drug mentioned in patent US 5,869,576 that was granted in 1999. It is a synthetic glycoprotein that stimulates chloride transport in the small intestine, and has been marketed in the USA as a drug to treat women with excessive postpartum stool. This paper analyses the patent and the scientific literature to provide a framework for understanding the rationale and context of the patent. Lubiprostone has been used in clinical trials for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, and its mechanism of action is understood. There is no evidence that lubiprostone is a clinically effective treatment for postpartum stool. The patent is invalid because it claims a product that is known and is not new. Lubiprostone is an effective treatment for diarrhoea associated with acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, and the patent claims a product that is known to be effective for these conditions. Lubiprostone is an effective treatment for diarrhoea associated with small intestinal bacterial over

Prompt:  MG is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: MG is a drug mentioned in patent applications for its effects on inhibiting fatty acid synthase, which can be useful in treating type 2 diabetes and cancer, but it also is a potent and specific agonist of α7 nAChR. Recent work by Elenkov et al. (2005) has demonstrated that the side effect of cholinergic overstimulation, observed with high doses of AChE inhibitors, can be avoided by the use of α7 nAChR agonists. The fact that nicotine acts at both α4β2 and α7 nAChRs has led to the use of nicotine in combination with AChE inhibitors. However, the nicotinic response is much greater at α7 nAChRs than at α4β2 nAChRs, which may explain why the nicotinic response can be beneficial at lower doses than the muscarinic response. In fact, Elenkov et al. (2005) have shown that α

Response: MK1064 is a drug mentioned in patent applications of Regorafenib (WO2008053824) and its use as an antineoplastic agent. However, it is unknown whether it has any activity in a rat cancer model. Here, we show that this agent has limited activity in a rat tumor model, and its efficacy is decreased in tumors that are resistant to EGFR inhibition.

**METHODS:** Rat tumor cell lines were obtained from the Tumor Cell Biology Program at the National Cancer Institute, and were characterized for *in vitro* sensitivity to MK1064. The efficacy of MK1064 in a rat tumor model was assessed in animals with tumors that were resistant to EGFR inhibition, by administering MK1064 and/or gefitinib daily for 5 days.

**RESULTS:** We observed no significant difference in efficacy between MK1064 and gefitinib, as assessed by T/C ratio. We

Response: MK571 is a drug mentioned in patent applications claiming to treat neurodegenerative disorders. This article discusses the clinical pharmacology of MK571. The author reviews the clinical pharmacology of MK571, focusing on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the drug. MK571 is a prodrug that requires activation by the liver enzyme, carboxylesterase-1. Because MK571 is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, it may cause a drug-drug interaction with P-glycoprotein substrates. The pharmacokinetics of MK571 in humans are unknown, and the drug is only approved for use in humans. MK571 is an investigational agent and is not currently approved for any use. There are currently no clinical trials of MK571 in humans, and the results of animal studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. MK571 is not an effective drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, and further clinical trials are needed to study

The well-established α~1~-blockers, such as prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin, are very effective for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [@bib0010]. Their clinical effectiveness is based on their ability to reduce the smooth muscle tone of the prostate. However, these drugs are known to cause erectile dysfunction (ED), and this may be an important reason for their discontinuation [@bib0015].

Introduction
============

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, and thus, control the intracellular concentration of these second messengers. In the brain, the cAMP and cGMP signalling pathways are important regulators of neuronal activity. They are involved in processes such as learning, memory, mood and cognition. Therefore, modulation of cAMP and cGMP signalling by PDEs has been implicated in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and Alzheimer's disease [@B1]-[@B3].

The PDE family consists of 11 members, each of which has a distinct tissue

A few years ago, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of melphalan for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is used in combination with prednisone, cyclophosphamide and/or vincristine. The combination therapy was shown to increase the survival of multiple myeloma patients, but the addition of melphalan did not improve the quality of life of these patients. Melphalan is generally not used as a single agent for the treatment of myeloma, but it is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The use of melph

Prompt:  Memantine is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Memantine is a drug mentioned in patent literature for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).1 The current treatment for PD is based on dopamine replacement, and the most used is the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA). Although it can reduce motor symptoms, it is often ineffective and its long-term use is associated with a series of side effects.2 For this reason, the development of new therapeutic strategies for PD is an unmet need. In the past, the search for alternative therapies has been based on compounds that can activate NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or 5-HT receptors.3-5 Recently, we have described that the NMDAR antagonist memantine is able to protect dopaminergic neurons against the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA in the rat,6,7 which could be relevant for the treatment of PD. In addition, memantine has been shown to reduce the accumulation of α-synuclein,8 the major component of

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

In contrast to the recent years, which have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of newly developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) \[[@CR1]\], the number of approved new chemical entities (NCEs) has been in steady decline \[[@CR2]\]. In 2015, the FDA approved only six new molecular entities, compared to eight in 2014 \[[@CR3]\]. The approval of a single drug for the treatment of only a few disorders represents a serious decline in drug development, and has also been criticized for causing high prices \[[@CR4]\].

Prompt:  Methylguanidine is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Methylguanidine is a drug mentioned in patent application EP 0 400 830, for example. It is a treatment for increasing the ability of the liver to produce urea. This increases the level of urea in the blood, which in turn reduces the amount of ammonia that is excreted in the urine. This treatment is particularly effective for patients with liver cirrhosis. It is also effective in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. It is not used to treat patients with Wilson's disease.
A certain percentage of patients with Wilson's disease have a disorder in which the liver does not produce enough urea, even when there is an adequate amount of ammonia in the blood. This is caused by a defect in the copper metabolism of the liver.
It has been shown that these patients have a high level of copper in the blood. The copper is deposited in the liver, and the cirrhosis becomes irreversible.

Prompt:  NADH, is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: NADH, is a drug mentioned in patent applications WO 2004/009546 and WO 2004/105740. A possible use of NADH is in the treatment of cancer, particularly leukaemia, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,929.
One problem with the use of NADH as a cancer treatment is that the levels of NADH in the cells can be very low, and can be increased only with difficulty, if at all. For example, it has been reported that the level of NADH in human leukaemia cells was around 3 μM. (Piotrowska, et al., Br. J. Haematol., 115, 657-666, 1999). Thus, a large number of leukaemia cells must be treated with NADH in order to achieve the desired result.

Response: NG25 is a drug mentioned in patent US 6,894,115 B2, which claims a combination of NKG2D-activating and NKG2D-blocking monoclonal antibodies. In the following study, the authors compared the efficacy of this drug in a humanized anti-NKG2D mouse model. They found that NKG2D-activating mAb is superior to NKG2D-blocking mAb in inhibiting the growth of a mouse tumor cell line that expresses a ligand for NKG2D. However, NKG2D-activating mAb is less effective in a mouse tumor cell line that does not express the NKG2D ligand. The authors proposed that NKG2D-activating mAb may have less effect in patients with high NKG2D expression, as the ligand for NKG2D is absent in these patients.

Prompt:  NSC is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: NSC is a drug mentioned in patent applications for treatment of diabetes, and is reported to increase the expression of GLUT4 in the heart. In diabetic patients with coronary heart disease, high levels of GLUT4 expression may be an important factor in the progression of diabetic complications. We investigated whether oral administration of NSC would improve the glucose tolerance and/or cardiac function in diabetic rats. In a high-fat diet-induced diabetic rat model, NSC significantly improved the glucose tolerance and lowered the blood glucose level in the serum. The expression of GLUT4 and Akt in the heart was also increased by NSC. In cultured cardiomyocytes, NSC increased the glucose uptake and improved the cardiac function. In conclusion, NSC may be a novel therapeutic agent for diabetic complications, and may also have beneficial effects on the heart.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) is an effective drug used for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders, with a therapeutic window of activity in the millimolar range, and a high therapeutic index. In some of these mitochondrial disorders, mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) enzyme lead to a decrease in PDC activity and a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity. In such disorders, DCA stimulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) enzyme, and this leads to increased production of pyruvate, which is then converted to acetyl-CoA by the PDC enzyme.

Prompt:  Niacin(acid) is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Niacin(acid) is a drug mentioned in patent WO2005056280 and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain lipid disorders. Niacin is classified as a BCS class II drug. This means that niacin is a poorly water-soluble compound with low aqueous solubility. Therefore, niacin is usually administered in an oil or an oil/water mixture in order to increase its aqueous solubility. However, such a formulation can lead to adverse gastrointestinal side effects and has a tendency to cause oily spotting on the skin. This makes it difficult to formulate a product containing niacin with the desired oral bioavailability.
In order to overcome these drawbacks, it has been proposed to use cyclodextrins as excipients for the oral administration of niacin (WO 2005056640). However, the use of cyclodextrins is still not sufficient to obtain the desired oral bio

The term “noradrenaline” is used in this application to mean noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) and its salts, esters and amides.
Noradrenaline is the principal sympathetic neurotransmitter in mammals. It acts as a stimulant of the heart and is also a major hormone involved in many physiological functions. It is released from adrenergic nerve endings and is synthesised in the adrenal medulla. Noradrenaline is formed by decarboxylation of dopamine. The decarboxylation reaction is catalysed by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). The enzyme is located in the inner membrane of chromaffin granules.
Noradrenaline is degraded by MAO (monoamine oxidase). It is transformed into

Response: PD-0332991 is a drug mentioned in patent US2011/0229063 and approved for cancer treatment. However, it has not been investigated for other diseases.

The potential application of the MPS-LPMPs in other fields is of great interest. For example, cancer cells are usually hyperproliferative and possess a high metabolic rate. Hence, their ability to take up drugs is much higher than normal cells, and the difference between the two can be used to differentiate between cancer cells and normal cells.

In conclusion, we have developed a label-free and easy-to-perform method to separate cancer cells from normal cells based on the differences in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The method has a great potential in the study of cancer cells and their treatment.

Prompt:  PF-06447475 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: PF-06447475 is a drug mentioned in patent documents for treatment of melanoma and as such it could be potentially harmful to patients who are not being treated with BRAF inhibitors. There are also a number of other Phase 1 studies that include the drug for a variety of indications.

While I was not able to find any specific studies that looked at how effective these drugs were in combination with other treatments, I did find some anecdotal information that suggests that some of the drugs could have an impact on response rates.

For example, a review by Lelievre et al. published in 2013, looked at the efficacy of three drug combinations for the treatment of melanoma. The study was randomized and patients were treated with a combination of ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor or ipilimumab and a MEK inhibitor. It showed that patients who received the BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor combination had a lower rate of disease progression compared to those who received ipil

2. Description of the Prior Art
Many pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system are mediated by excess production of aldosterone. Therefore, there is a great interest in the development of aldosterone receptor antagonists, especially as antihypertensive agents. One approach is the use of aldosterone receptor antagonists which antagonize the binding of aldosterone to its receptor.
Many compounds have been described as having this activity. Some of them are:

However, the aldosterone antagonists described in the prior art suffer from a number of disadvantages: they are not orally active, and are not selective for the aldosterone receptor.
WO 98/31682 discloses certain imidazole derivatives of general formula (I):

which have the ability to selectively antagonize the binding of aldosterone to its receptor.

Prompt:  PP1 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: PP1 is a drug mentioned in patent CN1710361. The CPP1 can inhibit the expression of the p53 gene, induce the cells to enter into the G2 phase of the cell cycle, thereby causing cell cycle arrest, and promote the expression of the CDKN1A gene, thereby inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.
As a drug for inducing the cell cycle arrest of tumor cells, CPP1 has been researched and applied in clinical studies. The clinical studies show that CPP1 has a good efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute leukemia, and the mechanism of CPP1 in inducing the cell cycle arrest of tumor cells is that it inhibits the expression of the p53 gene and inhibits the activity of the E2F transcription factor, thus blocking the G1/S transition.
Based on the research and application of CPP1, a new type of cell cycle-related anticancer drug has been developed, which has a similar mechanism of action to C

Prompt:  PU-H71 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: PU-H71 is a drug mentioned in patent applications and also in the scientific literature as an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor protein RB1 and the development of pancreatic cancer. We evaluated the effect of PU-H71 on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells by both in vitro and in vivo models. We observed that PU-H71 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and decreased the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo. Mechanistically, PU-H71 decreased RB1 protein levels, increased p53 levels, and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets including cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4. In addition, PU-H71 down-regulated the expression of survivin, a known target of p53. These results suggest that PU-H71 inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells by decreasing RB1 and increasing p53, and Akt signaling.

Prompt:  Pyridoxal is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: Pyridoxal is a drug mentioned in patent applications for a variety of therapeutic uses. It is the active form of vitamin B6, and has a wide variety of biological activities. In the literature, the term pyridoxal includes not only the free base but also a number of derivatives such as pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxamine phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxal itself. All of these compounds are useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, and the pharmacological activity of pyridoxal is based on its ability to reduce the activity of aldose reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glucose to sorbitol. This results in decreased activity of the sorbitol pathway, and thereby less sorbitol is formed in the cells, and consequently intracellular glucose levels decrease. As a result of this activity, pyridoxal is used in the treatment of a variety

^a^NCI has been using an ambiguous definition for growth inhibition. Growth inhibition is recorded for compounds with GI~50~\<20μM but the report does not specify whether this refers to the inhibition of cell proliferation, the induction of cell differentiation or some other endpoint. It is therefore possible that some compounds in this table may not have been shown to inhibit the growth of a cell line.

Hepatotoxicity {#Sec3}
==============

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that can be incorporated into DNA by the cellular deoxycytidine kinase, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and resulting in cell death. Gemcitabine is an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, gemcitabine also induces dose-limiting, dose-dependent, reversible hepatotoxicity.

Hepatotoxicity is a common side effect of cancer treatment and is a major cause of dose reduction and treatment discontinuation. Patients with advanced cancer are at risk of developing severe hepatic dysfunction. In particular, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is a highly hepatotoxic regimen that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the EORTC

Prompt:  RXDX-106 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: RXDX-106 is a drug mentioned in patent US20070087183 and approved for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). It has been known to act as an inhibitor of the androgen receptor. However, it has been shown that RXDX-106 also inhibits other androgen receptor-dependent pathways such as ARN-V7 (also called AR-V7) which is involved in cancer development. The inventors have found that the binding affinity of RXDX-106 to ARN-V7 is about one order of magnitude higher than to the androgen receptor. This allows for an inhibition of ARN-V7 and hence an inhibition of the growth of cells which express this protein. The inventors have found that RXDX-106 is able to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. RXDX-106 has been found to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer and in particular metastatic prostate cancer.

It has now been found that S3608 has significant activity at the 5-HT2A receptor, both as an agonist and as an antagonist. Thus S3608 is a dual 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor agonist.
The 5-HT2A receptor has been implicated in a number of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. It has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of other conditions including obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive disorders. In addition, the 5-HT2A receptor has also been suggested to play a role in the mechanism of migraine.
Thus the compounds of

Prompt:  S3610 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3610 is a drug mentioned in patent application WO2008/057537 and was found to be a good candidate for nanotechnology.

Lipid-based drug delivery systems have been considered as a good approach for targeting. The properties of these systems are based on the surface properties of the lipids, such as their ability to form vesicles. This could lead to the formation of a stable formulation with the right amount of drug. The release of the drug from the formulation depends on the chemical composition and the physical properties of the lipid-based system, such as the lipid composition, the drug loading, and the properties of the lipids and the drug.^[@ref29]^

A promising approach for drug delivery is the use of a lipid-based nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC).^[@ref30]^ This formulation has a bicontinuous structure that leads to the formation of multiple nanodomains in which

Biotin

Biotin is an important cofactor for carboxylases and amino acid transaminases. Biotin is also a precursor of coenzyme A. In mammals, biotin is involved in many biological processes, including the transport of fatty acids and ketone bodies in the blood, the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, the conversion of carbohydrates to fatty acids and ketone bodies, and the activation of carboxylases and amino acid transaminases. Biotin is synthesized from a biotin precursor, called pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester, which is produced from pimeloyl-CoA by pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester synthase. The biosynthetic pathway of biotin is illustrated in FIG. 2.

Prompt:  S3635 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3635 is a drug mentioned in patent US20050147474, which is an active metabolite of aripiprazole. The authors have reported that S3635 is responsible for more than half of the aripiprazole dose-dependent increase in prolactin levels, and that it has a high affinity for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors \[[@B32-ijms-20-02008]\]. In addition, they have also reported that aripiprazole increases the risk of elevation of prolactin levels, but that this risk can be minimized by co-administration of aripiprazole with a serotonin receptor antagonist \[[@B33-ijms-20-02008]\]. Therefore, in this study, we measured the serum prolactin levels in patients who were administered with aripiprazole and co-administered with either risperidone or haloperidol.

The human cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is a major cGMP hydrolyzing enzyme in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, which is the major component of the male erectile tissue. Inhibition of PDE5 results in increased cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum and, thereby, induces an increase of the penis erection. Inhibition of PDE5 is therefore an effective therapy for erectile dysfunction. Inhibition of PDE5 leads to increased cGMP-levels and, thereby, to smooth muscle relaxation. As a result, blood flow is increased to the penis and, thereby, the erection is induced. The male erectile tissue contains, inter alia, smooth muscle cells and corpus cavern

Response: S3676 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2008040364. This patent was issued to Wyeth in 2007 and describes a broad group of compounds with a benzimidazole structure as a possible treatment for CF.

Wyeth has also filed for patents in the UK and France on this class of compounds. This is discussed in more detail in the section below on drug development.

It is worth noting that Wyeth have recently abandoned the pursuit of CFTR modulators and are now pursuing a different strategy with the aim of developing small molecules that work via a different mechanism. The Wyeth compound in clinical development, SZK-9274, is a potentiator of the VX-770 positive allosteric modulator of CFTR.

The second major class of CFTR modulators that are in clinical development are the small molecules that stimulate chloride transport. In this section we will discuss the approaches taken to develop these compounds and their associated clinical status

Response: S3700 is a drug mentioned in patent WO 98/16247 and has the following structure:

S3700 was developed by Alkermes, Inc. and was found to have activity in the rat Toxoplasma gondii infection model (a model that mimics human congenital toxoplasmosis). Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii is one of the most common parasites of humans and infects almost everyone. In pregnant women, T. gondii can cause severe disease in the fetus, with symptoms including miscarriage, stillbirth, and congenital disease. In the United States, approximately 1 in 5,000 people is infected with T. gondii, and of those, approximately 5% will have a disease that is serious enough to require hospitalization. Congenital toxoplasmosis is the most serious manifestation of T. gondii infection in pregnancy.

Prompt:  S3800 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3800 is a drug mentioned in patent applications for the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, the effects of the neuroleptic S3800 on cocaine-induced dopamine release in rat striatal synaptosomes and on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats were investigated. The in vitro data showed that S3800 had a significant effect on the release of dopamine induced by cocaine, with a maximum effect at 100 microM. The in vivo data showed that S3800 did not modify the locomotor activity of cocaine in the open field test. However, in the dark-light test, S3800 (30 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased the duration of the hyperlocomotion induced by cocaine (5 mg/kg i.p.). These data suggest that the antipsychotic effect of S3800 is not due to its influence on cocaine-induced dopamine release in the striatum, but may be related to its capacity to modify cocaine-

Prompt:  S3808 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3808 is a drug mentioned in patent US20120193117. It is being developed by ITRC, a startup founded by Stanford-educated doctors. In preclinical testing, the drug showed the ability to stimulate and inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of lung cancer. Its name is TCL-3808, and it is currently being tested in a Phase I clinical trial.

"The reason why we wanted to find out about TCL-3808 is that it's a very specific inhibitor of a very important driver of lung cancer," says the principal investigator of the Phase I trial, oncologist Dr. Edward Chen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "It's a very exciting development because it has the potential to turn the treatment of lung cancer on its head."

Prompt:  S3809 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3809 is a drug mentioned in patent application WO2005037342A1 which has the structure shown in FIG. 1.

S3809 was synthesized and tested in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoporosis. The therapeutic effect of S3809 was found to be equivalent to or better than that of calcitonin. The most important advantage of S3809 over calcitonin is that S3809 is a selective TRPV1 antagonist, whereas calcitonin is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. The binding site of S3809 is located at the intracellular side of TRPV1, and the binding affinity of S3809 is approximately 30 times stronger than that of capsazepine, a classical TRPV1 antagonist. Thus, S3809 has the potential to be developed as a new class of osteoporosis drugs.

6. Conclusions {#sec6-ijms-20-00533}
==============

In conclusion, this study has provided novel information on the role of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 in the metabolism of the novel anti-diabetic agent, S3843. The metabolism of S3843 was examined in vitro using liver microsomes from humans and various animal species, and in vivo using rat and mouse species. A role for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in the metabolism of S3843 was observed. However, the contribution of CYP3A7 to the metabolism of S3843 in vivo was not established. In addition, there was no correlation between the activity of CYP3A enzymes and the in vivo metabolism of S3843 in rats and mice.

Response: S3852 is a drug mentioned in patent applications (e.g., WO2004/104070) and has a potency of 5-HT1A receptor antagonism of IC50=0.3 nM. In the present study, the effect of S3852 on the growth of transplanted C6 glioma cells was examined. Intraperitoneal injection of S3852 significantly suppressed the growth of C6 glioma cells. The S3852 treatment also prolonged the survival of the C6 glioma bearing rats. Moreover, S3852 at 1.5 mg/kg reduced the number of viable C6 glioma cells and increased the expression of activated caspase-3 in the C6 glioma cells. These findings suggest that S3852 suppresses the growth of C6 glioma cells and that S3852 may be a potential drug for glioma treatment.

Structure and mechanism of action
The crystal structure of the ADPR-complex with the CD38/ADPR-T enzyme has been published. It shows that the ADPR-enzyme complex has a shape of a right triangle, where the binding site is formed by the ADPR-binding groove of the enzyme. The binding site of the ADPR-enzyme complex is filled with ADPR and water molecules, the binding of the second molecule of ADPR is mainly driven by electrostatic forces.

There are two different enzymatic activities of CD38/ADPR-T. The first one is a phosphotransferase activity, which is similar to the activity of CD38 and was identified as ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. The second one is a cyclase activity, which was identified as cyclase activity, and the substrate for this enzyme is NAD.

Tox-II has been described as a class of drugs that induce mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening by a direct binding to the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) [@bib0115]. This mechanism of action explains the high toxicity of these drugs. It also explains the lack of anti-cancer activity observed for some of them, since cancer cells have lower ATP levels than non-transformed cells and, consequently, mPTP opening is not triggered. Tox-II is also a toxic mechanism that is common to all the other members of the class of these drugs, including prochlorperazine.

Introduction {#s0010}
============

Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a major threat to human and animal health, as well as a potential threat to the efficacy of animal production. Consequently, there is a constant need for new antimicrobial agents, particularly ones with novel modes of action. The discovery of novel antimicrobial agents is hampered by the fact that antimicrobial resistance is a consequence of exposure to antimicrobials, and is not acquired *de novo* by bacteria. Thus, it is important to identify new antimicrobial targets that can be used as points of intervention in the bacterial cell, thereby reducing the chances of resistance arising.

The process of infection involves bacterial adhesion to host tissues, followed by the initiation of the bacterial replication cycle, and subsequent bacterial translocation across

The results of our study showed that oral treatment with S3924 significantly delayed the onset of RR-EAE in female SJL/J mice. It was effective when started from day 7 post-immunization, but only a mild delay was achieved when treatment was initiated from day 10 post-immunization. In addition, the protective effect of S3924 was not accompanied by any beneficial effect on clinical score, which remained very low and unchanged in S3924-treated mice.

Prompt:  S3988 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S3988 is a drug mentioned in patent application WO 03/018727 A1. The effect of S3988 on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been studied in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) (Kato et al. 2005, Acta Endocrinologica, vol. 146, pp. 663-669). A significant decrease in plasma aldosterone was observed after a single oral dose of S3988 (100 mg) in patients with PA, but no changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) were observed. However, in patients with PA the increase in PRA following a single oral dose of S3988 was significantly lower than that observed in healthy volunteers. This observation was interpreted as evidence for a reduced sensitivity of the RAS to angiotensin II (Ang II) in PA. This study indicates that a single oral dose of S3988 is able to reduce plasma ald

Response: S4246 is a drug mentioned in patent WO 01/67002 A1.

The inhibition of SGLT2 is a therapeutic target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. See, for example, Patent WO 99/19313 A1, Patent WO 00/34241 A1, and Patent WO 99/51259 A1.
In type 2 diabetes, a reduction in glucose reabsorption in the kidney is indicated as a factor in the development of diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors are expected to be a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because they increase urinary glucose excretion, and thus they have the effect of controlling blood glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia.
SGLT2 inhibitors have also been reported to exert an insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect in type 2 diabetic patients, which makes it possible to use them in combination with insulin (see, for example, Patent WO 02/083661

In this patent application, a new use of S4503 is described as an inhibitor of the human enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). This enzyme is the key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Therefore, HMGR inhibitors are a potential class of drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.

This drug was originally developed as a second-generation antagonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and -γ, which are receptors that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism. It has been shown that TZDs inhibit macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue and the subsequent inflammation of adipose tissue. TZDs also increase adiponectin secretion, thereby improving insulin sensitivity. These pleiotropic effects of TZDs may be useful for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The administration of TZDs in patients with CVD has been found to be safe and well tolerated. However, the use of TZDs is limited by their

Conclusion {#s0011}
==========

To conclude, it is shown that the \[^11^C\]PBB3 ligand is highly specific for the α~4~β~2~ nAChR subtype in the rat brain. The presence of nAChR subtypes other than the α~4~β~2~ subtype is excluded. \[^11^C\]PBB3 is an attractive candidate for studying the α~4~β~2~ nAChR subtype in human brain.

This work was supported by grants from the Danish Cancer Society (R34-A2714) and the EU (FP7-ICT-2007-216334).

Response: S4590 is a drug mentioned in patent CN1562929A. This paper aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of S4590 in the rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). The rat model of CIRI was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. S4590 was given intraperitoneally after CIRI induction. Neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, and neurogenesis were evaluated at 3, 7, and 14 days after CIRI. The expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) were evaluated at 14 days after CIRI. S4590 treatment significantly improved neurological deficit scores, reduced infarct volume, and promoted neurogenesis in the ischemic cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, S4590 treatment increased the expression of MAP2 and the proliferation of NSCs. These findings

Prompt:  S4625 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S4625 is a drug mentioned in patent US20130306716A1 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In contrast to this and the other known TK inhibitors, e.g. Imatinib, which are specific to the active conformation of the enzyme, S4625 binds to both the inactive and active conformation of the enzyme and is thereby able to inhibit the enzyme's activity. The result of this is that S4625 is able to inhibit the activity of c-Abl at lower concentrations than the other known inhibitors. S4625 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme c-Abl. In in vitro studies, S4625 inhibited proliferation of a panel of cell lines expressing c-Abl and was more effective in inhibiting proliferation than in inhibiting the enzyme's activity. It is an inhibitor of the enzyme c-Abl and of other kinases. S4625 is orally active and is highly selective for c-A

Response: S4638 is a drug mentioned in patent documents WO2006/009811, WO2008/042420, and WO2010/143327. The mechanism of action of S4638 is the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). DHF is a critical metabolite in the biosynthesis of thymidylate, purines, and methionine. Inhibition of DHFR causes an accumulation of THF, a product of the reaction. Because of the importance of THF in the biosynthesis of purines and methionine, cells are unable to proliferate when DHFR is inhibited.
DHFR inhibitors are used to treat cancer, bacterial infections, and parasitic infections. They are also used to treat malaria, since the parasite responsible for the disease is a parasite of the genus

Discussion {#S0003}
==========

In this study, we have used whole-genome RNA-Seq data from two different studies to determine the transcriptional profiles of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes in the presence of three different NSAIDs and rifampicin. This analysis identified the differentially expressed genes, and pathways that were modulated by each of the treatments. The use of the IPA knowledgebase enabled us to link the differentially expressed genes to the potential cellular mechanisms modulated by the NSAIDs and rifampicin.

We used three different NSAIDs, indomethacin, celecoxib, and dicl

Prompt:  S4701 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S4701 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2011/041152 and used for the treatment of TNF-mediated inflammatory diseases. We compared the effect of S4701 with that of the traditional drugs such as naproxen and infliximab. We used HT-29 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, as a model to test the effect of S4701 on TNF-mediated cell death. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of S4701, naproxen, and infliximab for 6 h. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay.

Cell viability assay
--------------------

Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Briefly, HT-29 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10^4^ cells per well in 96-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with S4701, naproxen, and infliximab

Prompt:  S4702 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S4702 is a drug mentioned in patent US2004/0145647. This drug has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo against Leishmania and Trypanosoma brucei parasites. Its mechanism of action is thought to be similar to that of mefloquine, which inhibits the proton pump and blocks the movement of protons across the membrane. It also causes a decrease in the amount of calcium that is stored in the lysosome of the parasite, thereby leading to the lysosomal membrane being destabilized.

Prompt:  S4790 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S4790 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2011032334, claiming the use of S4790 as an analgesic and as an analgesic adjuvant in a pain treatment.

The analysis of S4790 has been made by using the standard procedures of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office on Drug Control (UNODC) to determine the presence of the drug in bulk and dosage units of the pharmaceutical product AEROSOL®.

S4790 was found in only one bulk unit (0.05%), and it was detected at the limit of quantification (LOQ). This finding is not alarming, as it is not considered as a concentration that can affect the safety and effectiveness of the product, since the consumption of 0.05% of S4790 in a daily dose of 5 mL of the AEROSOL® is less than the daily dose that a person can take by inhalation (5 mg).

Because of the small amount of available resources and the limitations of time and money, the method for detecting S4852 in biological samples is often based on a traditional assay, and most studies use an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect S4852 in biological samples. However, the ELISA method is highly affected by the specificity and affinity of antibodies, and the existing ELISA kits for S4852 are expensive and time-consuming, and they are difficult to be applied in clinical tests. Therefore, a rapid and low-cost detection method for S4852 in biological samples is urgently needed.

The development of portable, rapid, and low-cost diagnostic devices is a rapidly developing area of the biological and medical sciences. The emergence of portable and low-cost biosensors has received increasing attention in

Prompt:  S4866 is a drug mentioned in patent
 
Response: S4866 is a drug mentioned in patent WO2011/117582, which has been shown to have beneficial effects on a number of key pathways implicated in cancer (i.e. angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and DNA damage). We observed that the decrease in tumor volume after treatment with S4866 in a xenograft model was associated with a reduction in both cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. This reduction in cell proliferation was also observed in the 2D-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, our data support the finding that S4866 is a drug with a potential anti-cancer effect.

One limitation of our study is that the data are obtained from 2D-cultures of cancer cells, which lack the complexity of the tumor environment. Further studies are therefore needed to evaluate the effects of S4866 in more complex in vivo models. Another limitation is that the biological effect of S4866 on the tumor

Conclusions {#Sec16}
===========

Cationic derivatives of *β*-alanine and lysine, as well as the parent *β*-alanine, are able to enter mitochondria and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, all of the compounds tested significantly increased the level of ROS in cells. Our findings provide an explanation for the efficacy of *β*-alanine as an adjuvant in anticancer therapies and suggest that *β*-alanine and its derivatives may be a new class of mitochondria-targeted drugs.
