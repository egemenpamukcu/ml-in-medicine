Enter prompt or quit: Prompt:  (+)-JQ1 is a drug also known as
 
Response: (+)-JQ1 is a drug also known as OTX015 and known to bind BET family proteins and have potent effects in cellular assays. BET inhibitors have demonstrated potent activity in clinical trials, but are associated with adverse side effects including myelosuppression. In an effort to mitigate these effects, we used genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit BET proteins in mice to assess their therapeutic potential. We find that BET inhibition is highly effective at reversing EZH2-driven hematologic malignancies in mice, including AML and MDS, and reduces leukemia burden and prolongs survival. BET inhibition is also highly effective at reversing MLL-fusion-driven AML in mice, suggesting that BET inhibition may be broadly useful in MLL-fusion-driven leukemias. Our findings indicate that BET inhibition may be an effective treatment for EZH2-driven hematologic malignancies and are broadly applicable to MLL-fusion-driven

Response: 1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene is a drug also known as fluorobenzene, which is a starting material for a wide range of pharmaceuticals. It is a known and potent carcinogen and the corresponding nitroso compound is also a suspected carcinogen. Fluorobenzene is known to cause severe headaches, nausea, vomiting and transient liver toxicity, but it is rapidly metabolised to give a number of polar metabolites, some of which are pharmacologically active. A major metabolic pathway involves conjugation with glucuronic acid, with the corresponding glucuronide being the major metabolite in blood and urine. In contrast, the nitroso compound is rapidly detoxified to the corresponding nitroso-compound, which is much less toxic and does not undergo metabolic activation.
The toxicity of 1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene has been attributed to the presence of the nitroso group in the molecule, which is converted to
