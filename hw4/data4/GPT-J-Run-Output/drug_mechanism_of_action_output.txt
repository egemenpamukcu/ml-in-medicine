Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin is complex and not fully understood, but it is thought to induce cell cycle arrest by interfering with DNA replication. It is believed that 10-hydroxycamptothecin causes cell cycle arrest by interfering with the synthesis of DNA.

At the FDA-approved dose of 20 mg/m^2^, 10-hydroxycamptothecin has a half-life of 2 h, and it is metabolized by a non-specific esterase. It is also eliminated through the biliary and fecal routes. Because of the high lipophilicity of 10-hydroxycamptothecin, it is only moderately absorbed in the small intestine, with a bioavailability of about 10% and an oral clearance of about 200 mL/min. The compound is excreted in the feces and is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 17-Beta-Estradiol-3,17-Dipropionate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 17-Beta-Estradiol-3,17-Dipropionate is dependent on the interaction with estrogen receptors (ERs). In this regard, the synthetic estrogen Bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to act through estrogen receptors to induce estrogenic effects in a number of tissues.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2,4-dichlorobenzyl is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2,4-dichlorobenzyl isothiocyanate (DCDITC) was studied in two tumor cell lines of different origins, namely, murine mammary adenocarcinoma (MM48) and human colon carcinoma (HT-29). The kinetics of its cytotoxicity were followed by the MTT assay and its cytostatic activity was studied by a growth-delay assay. The results show that DCDITC is a fast-acting cytotoxic compound, exhibiting IC50 values in the micromolar range. DCDITC inhibits DNA synthesis, but the decrease in cell proliferation was not directly proportional to the amount of inhibition of DNA synthesis. The observed inhibition of DNA synthesis is the result of a reduced uptake of thymidine into cells and of a concomitant decreased incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2-Amino-6-methylheptan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2-Amino-6-methylheptan is that it causes reduction of serotonin (5-HT) in the CNS by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter. This leads to an increase in the concentration of 5-HT in the synapse. 5-HT in the brain has an important role in the regulation of emotions, sleep, appetite, and behavior. The synthesis and reuptake of 5-HT is a critical component in maintaining normal CNS function. When a nerve impulse arrives at the presynaptic terminal, 5-HT is released and binds to 5-HT1 receptors. This allows the 5-HT to be transported back into the cell by the reuptake transporter. 2-Amino-6-methylheptan is a potent inhibitor of the reuptake transporter.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2-Aminoethanethiol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2-Aminoethanethiol is not known, but its activity is presumably due to the presence of a sulfur atom which can react with free radicals. 2-Aminoethanethiol has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity in several in vitro and in vivo studies.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2-Aminoethyl is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2-Aminoethyl isothiuronium (AET) is the deacetylation of the N-acetyl group on the alpha-amino group of histone proteins. This deacetylation reduces the positive charge on the histones, which makes them more tightly bound to the DNA and less accessible to transcription factors. This can affect gene expression and therefore gene expression can be used as a marker for gene activation. This marker can be used to test the safety of an environment and to determine the concentration of AET in the environment.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in the process of revising its ambient water quality criteria for AET. The EPA has issued an interim drinking water standard for AET of 0.25 micrograms per liter. However, the EPA also recognizes that the AET drinking water standard may not be protective of human health.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2-Methoxyestradiol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2-Methoxyestradiol is unknown. Since 2-Methoxyestradiol is metabolized in the body into 2-Methoxyestrone and 2-Methoxyestradiol-3-glucuronide, it is unlikely that it acts via the estrogen receptor. In vitro studies suggest that 2-Methoxyestradiol acts as a tumor-selective growth inhibitor and as an inducer of apoptosis.2

2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is a metabolite of 17β-estradiol (E2) that can bind to the estrogen receptor with approximately one thousand times the affinity of E2. It has been shown that 2-ME has anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.2,3,5,6

Although E2 is considered a weak estrogen, it is still capable of binding to estrogen receptors, which have two subtypes, α

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 2-Methylhexanoic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 2-Methylhexanoic is involved in various processes of human metabolism. It is well-known that 2-Methylhexanoic acid is converted to 2-Methylbutanoic acid and 2-Methylpentanoic acid by the enzyme 2-Methylpentanoic acid dehydrogenase (2MPDH) and 2-Methylpentanoic acid dehydrogenase (2MPDH) respectively. It is known that 2MPDH is a key enzyme in the 2-methylbutanoic acid pathway and 2MPDH is a key enzyme in the 2-methylpentanoic acid pathway (Schaechter et al., 1996, Adv. Synth. Catal. 1998, 30, 1605-1615).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 3469-LCZ696 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 3469-LCZ696 is not fully understood. It is likely that this novel molecule binds to the myosin binding protein C and thereby inhibits the opening of the ATP channel on the surface of the L-type calcium channel. The subsequent decrease in the calcium influx through the calcium channel results in a reduced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore a reduced calcium accumulation in the myocardial cells \[[@CR30]\]. However, this is not the only mechanism by which this drug works. In a recent study, it was shown that the inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by 3469-LCZ696 contributes to the beneficial effects of this drug in HF patients \[[@CR32]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 4SC-201(resminostat,BYK408740) is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 4SC-201(resminostat,BYK408740) is to inhibit the function of the histone deacetylase enzyme, HDAC1. HDAC1 is an enzyme that deacetylates histones and non-histone proteins. HDAC1 has been shown to be involved in the deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins such as p53, tubulin, HSP90, estrogen receptor, and Ku70. By deacetylating these proteins, HDAC1 inhibits apoptosis and increases the stability of the cell. The primary mechanism of action of 4SC-201 is to increase the acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. The increased acetylation of these proteins causes them to become more biologically active. 4SC-201 has been shown to increase the acetylation of histones, and non-histone proteins in cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 5-HTP is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 5-HTP is unclear. It has been proposed that it is a precursor of serotonin. Some investigators believe that it acts by inhibiting the metabolism of tryptophan, which leads to increased concentrations of serotonin. It is also possible that it acts by inhibiting the transport of serotonin into platelets and red blood cells. Other investigators believe that it is converted into serotonin by the action of an enzyme that is not found in the brain. However, studies with animals have shown that 5-HTP does not pass through the blood-brain barrier and that it does not enter the brain itself. Some investigators have suggested that 5-HTP is converted into 5-HT in the gut and then absorbed and metabolized in the liver. However, other investigators have not found any significant differences in blood levels of serotonin or 5-HTP when 5-HTP was administered alone or with tryptophan.

Some studies suggest that the administration of 5-HT

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of 7-Aminocephalosporanic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of 7-Aminocephalosporanic is presented in this report. The possibility of using this mechanism of action in the design of new cephalosporins with a broader spectrum of activity is discussed. The 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) is a semi-synthetic analogue of cephalosporanic C-3 side chain which has a different mechanism of action. It is produced by a bacterial deacetylation of the acetyl-7-ACA to obtain 7-ACA. This semi-synthetic compound is not metabolized by human beings. The method of action of this new class of cephalosporin will be presented in this report. 7-ACA is an inhibitor of penicillin-binding proteins. Inhibition of these proteins blocks the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall and, therefore, this mechanism of action is bactericidal. The spectrum of action of 7-ACA will

Response: The mechanism of action of 8-Hydroxyquinoline is not well understood. In this study we have used molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of 8-hydroxyquinoline to two homologous proteins, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). We found that 8-hydroxyquinoline is capable of binding in the active site of both AChE and BChE, with an affinity similar to that of the parent compound, 8-hydroxyquinoline. In both cases, 8-hydroxyquinoline bound in a similar orientation, with the 8-hydroxyquinoline moiety placed in the oxyanion hole and the hydroxyquinoline moiety in the gorge. We also found that 8-hydroxyquinoline can stabilize the active conformation of the esteratic site in AChE and BChE. Our results indicate that 8-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Abametapir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Abametapir is thought to be via the selective inhibition of mutant APP-CTFs, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. This has been shown in both mouse and human models. This mechanism of action was also thought to occur in the brain, where APP-CTFs were found to accumulate in the hippocampus of Abametapir-treated mice and in Abametapir-treated AD patients. This accumulation was seen in areas of the brain where APP-CTFs were also seen to accumulate in the brains of the APP transgenic mice. This led to the hypothesis that Abametapir would exert its beneficial effects in AD by decreasing the levels of APP-CTFs in the brain.
The findings that Abametapir-treated AD patients had lower levels of total and sAPP-β in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to placebo-treated patients supports this hypothesis. However, this has

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ABC294640 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ABC294640 is not yet fully understood. One theory is that it works by activating the Wnt pathway, and therefore increasing the stability of β-catenin. β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes that are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Another theory is that ABC294640 acts by inhibiting the interaction of T-cell factor (TCF) with its co-activator, β-catenin. It has also been shown to inhibit the interaction of β-catenin with several other proteins, including: GSK3β, histone deacetylase, c-Jun, and P53.

In a Phase IIa trial, a high dose of ABC294640 was given to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The trial was terminated early after it was shown that the treatment had no effect on patient survival. A Phase IIb trial is currently ongoing

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ABELCET is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ABELCET is to enhance the efficacy of clopidogrel, thereby providing greater inhibition of platelet aggregation and an increased bleeding time. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active metabolite, clopidogrel carboxylic acid. Clopidogrel carboxylic acid is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of the ADP-dependent platelet P2Y12 receptor. Clopidogrel carboxylic acid binds to the ADP-receptor and prevents ADP-mediated signal transduction.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Abiraterone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Abiraterone is unknown, but likely involves the androgen receptor (AR). In particular, the active metabolite (Abiraterone acetate) has been shown to bind the AR with high affinity, and the inhibition of the enzyme activity of CYP17A1 by Abiraterone and its active metabolite is believed to contribute to its anticancer activity. It has been shown that the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells is dependent on the presence of CYP17A1 and androgen receptor. (See “Abiraterone acetate (AA) a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer” by E. S. Querfeld, et al., J. Clin. Oncol., 26(2), p. 293-302 (2008)).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ABT-199 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ABT-199 is very interesting. By using an F-box domain mutant of BCL-2, ABT-199 is able to bind BCL-2 and other proteins involved in ubiquitination of BCL-2. ABT-199 then binds to BCL-2 and prevents its ability to bind to BCL-X~L~, which in turn, inhibits BCL-2-mediated apoptosis. This mechanism of action was recently reviewed in a recent publication by Walsh et al. ([@B58]).

A small molecule BH3-mimetic called A-1210477 has also been described to block the interaction between BCL-2 and BCL-X~L~, and is being developed as a therapeutic agent for various hematologic malignancies (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}B) ([@B59]). It is a reversible, ATP-competitive

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ABT-888(Veliparib) is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ABT-888(Veliparib) is thought to be mediated by the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity. PARP-1 is a nuclear protein that plays a role in DNA repair, chromatin structure, transcription, cell cycle progression and cell death. PARP-1 is activated by single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs). In the presence of PARP-1, the ADP-ribose polymer is synthesized on the acceptor protein, which in turn recruits the chromatin remodeling factor. Inhibition of PARP-1 activity prevents the repair of SSBs and DSBs. ABT-888 (Veliparib) was the first PARP-1 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Other PARP-1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical

Response: The mechanism of action of Acalabrutinib is related to the suppression of BCR-ABL-dependent activation of kinase activity and/or the inhibition of the binding of BCR-ABL to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The biological effects of Acalabrutinib may include the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation. The pharmacokinetic profile of Acalabrutinib is characterized by rapid absorption and moderate to high bioavailability after oral administration. In a pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers, Acalabrutinib was shown to bind to BCR-ABL with high affinity and inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Acalabrutinib has been evaluated in patients with CML and ALL.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Aceclidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Aceclidine is similar to that of Ketamine and Ethanol.

Mechanism of Action

Anesthesia:

The first analgesic effect of Aceclidine occurs in the peripheral nervous system, and is primarily due to the antagonistic action of Aceclidine on the NMDA receptor. The inhibition of the NMDA receptor leads to the inhibition of excitatory amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) from being released into the synapse, which is the major mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) anesthesia.

The analgesic effect is secondary to the peripheral analgesic effect.

Antitussive:

The antitussive effect of Aceclidine is mainly caused by the inhibition of central cholinergic and purinergic receptors. The cholinergic receptors include M1, M2, M3, and M4, which are distributed in the central nervous system, and the purinergic receptors

Response: The mechanism of action of Acipimox is inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol, and to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, a precursor of the isoprenoids that are essential for the survival of eukaryotic cells. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase causes a decrease in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which results in the inhibition of the synthesis of many other cell components such as dolichols and ubiquinones, the later necessary for the anchoring of protein molecules on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in the accumulation of incompletely synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a consequence, there is an accumulation of incompletely assembled membrane proteins

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Acitretin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Acitretin is poorly understood. The drug is metabolized in the liver, where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to form an inactive metabolite. The metabolite is then eliminated by biliary excretion. Acitretin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP3A4 in humans and in vitro studies have shown it to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. There is some evidence that Acitretin may inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity in the liver by binding to the enzyme or to its cytochrome b5 (CYB5) reductase. The drug has also been shown to induce CYP2C9 activity in humans and to increase CYP2C9 mRNA in cultured human hepatocytes. In a clinical study, serum concentrations of Acit

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Aclidinium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Aclidinium is not fully understood. However, a major role for the muscarinic M3 receptor has been suggested in mediating the therapeutic effect of Aclidinium in the airways of COPD patients. The mechanism of action of tiotropium is understood in terms of the presence of an active metabolite, namely, N-desethyl tiotropium.
Inhaled bronchodilators are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of COPD. However, the therapeutic effects of these agents are often limited, and the majority of patients require multiple drugs to control their symptoms and prevent exacerbations.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Acrivastine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Acrivastine is similar to other histamine H1 receptor antagonists in that it blocks the action of histamine at the H1 receptor and prevents the release of histamine. In addition to the above, Acrivastine has the additional benefit of not producing sedation. The use of the term sedation with regard to H1 receptor antagonists is not clearly defined, and is in fact not uniformly accepted in the art. However, sedation is generally accepted to be a pharmacodynamic effect of H1 receptor antagonists which results in drowsiness.
The mechanism of action of Acrivastine is different from other second-generation antihistamines in that it does not possess intrinsic H1 receptor antagonist activity. Acrivastine has been shown to have an IC50 of 100 nM at the human H1 receptor. The value of Acrivastine is its very low intrinsic activity at the H1 receptor. Therefore, in contrast to the first generation H

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ACTIGALL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ACTIGALL is based on the formation of a physical complex between the anti-tumour cell antibody and the ACTIGALL protein.

The result of this complex is the killing of tumour cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a chimeric, human-mouse monoclonal antibody which binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells.

In vivo it blocks the binding of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the EGFR, and thus inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and reduces their ability to grow and spread.

This action leads to the suppression of tumour growth.

The antibodies and ACTIGALL® products are not for use in combination with any other treatment, unless specified.

The recommended starting dose of cetuximab is 400 mg/m

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ACTIN-N is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ACTIN-N is still unknown. However, it is conceivable that the binding of actin-N to actin may disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, thereby interfering with cell migration. Actin-N also contains two PDZ domains. Although the function of these domains is still unknown, the presence of a second PDZ domain in actin-N is intriguing. Perhaps this domain can bind to another protein that may be important for cell migration. In addition, the presence of the second PDZ domain may indicate that actin-N may have an alternate function in cells that is unrelated to cell migration. This possibility is consistent with the presence of a proline-rich region in the C-terminal half of actin-N. A similar proline-rich region has been shown to be necessary for the interaction of actin-N with the Cdc42 protein \[[@B10]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ACY-1215 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ACY-1215 is through a new class of chemokine receptor called CCR5, which is a co-receptor for HIV.

Mutation in CCR5 can lead to resistance to HIV infection, and this is why people with this mutation are called "HIV resistant".

In the treatment of HIV infection, the main drug used to inhibit HIV is the combination of three drugs called antiretroviral therapy (ART).

As HIV infection progresses, it is usually accompanied by increased levels of CCR5.

The more CCR5 the virus has, the more susceptible it is to the treatment.

A study by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) scientists in the USA found that treatment with the drug AMD3100 - a CCR5 antagonist - in combination with standard ART (combination of three drugs) reduced CCR5 in the blood and was able to significantly reduce the risk of the disease

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Acyclovir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Acyclovir is not completely understood. It has been postulated that Acyclovir inhibits the enzyme DNA polymerase, thereby preventing the virus from replicating. Acyclovir may also have a direct anti-viral effect.
Acyclovir has been shown to be an effective treatment for herpes virus infections, including genital herpes. In fact, Acyclovir has been shown to be more effective than other anti-viral drugs, such as interferon and cidofovir, in the treatment of recurrent herpes. Acyclovir is administered orally, and the medication is often taken once a day. Although Acyclovir is effective in the treatment of herpes virus infections, the benefits of the medication may be offset by the undesirable side effects associated with the medication. For example, Acyclovir has been shown to cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Adriamycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Adriamycin is thought to be the induction of apoptosis. While this is a major mechanism of Adriamycin action, the possibility that Adriamycin may also act through other mechanisms has been suggested. In particular, Adriamycin has been reported to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II and the enzyme is inhibited by Adriamycin. It has also been suggested that Adriamycin inhibits DNA topoisomerase II by stabilizing the enzyme-DNA cleavage complex. However, in contrast to the other known DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, Adriamycin does not induce cleavage of the DNA when incubated with isolated topoisomerase II. The mechanism of action of Adriamycin in vivo is still unknown, but the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II is thought to be a significant mechanism of action.

3.1. MAPK Pathway {#sec3dot1-cancers-12-01168}
------------------

The MAPK pathway is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells. It is a series of proteins that are activated when the receptors are stimulated by a stimulus. These proteins are associated with a variety of cell processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. It consists of a cascade of kinases that are activated by external signals and then they can activate other proteins that can affect the MAPK pathway. In cancer cells, this pathway is activated by mutations in genes that regulate the MAPK pathway. There are three proteins that are included in the MAPK pathway: RAF, MEK, and ERK. RAF is a protein that is encoded by the *RAF1* gene. It is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Alanine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Alanine is not fully understood, but it is generally accepted that alanine (Ala) works as a 'trigger' of the natural release of epinephrine, noradrenaline, and dopamine from the adrenal medulla, thereby stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. Alanine is known to be an essential amino acid, required in the diet, and to play a role in protein synthesis.

Alanine has a number of potential benefits:

1. Alanine helps to maintain the proper balance of sodium and potassium in the body. A high level of sodium in the body has been linked to high blood pressure and an increased risk of heart disease.

2. High levels of alanine in the blood have been linked to a reduction in blood sugar.

The clinical trials with Alarelin have shown that the hormone has a very potent and specific effect on the treatment of adrenal insufficiency, particularly on aldosterone secretion and on the volume of the extracellular fluid.

In order to make Alarelin available for clinical use, the drug must be first manufactured. As a matter of fact, the development of the hormone was initially conducted by Nesbios Biotech (now Baxalta Pharmaceuticals) and was further developed by Laboratoires Arsanis (now Valeant Pharmaceuticals).

Response: The mechanism of action of ALDOCLOR-250 is not known, but there are several possible explanations for the observed results. A direct action of the extract on myocardial contractility is unlikely, since the drug did not alter the action potential duration and did not change the negative dromotropic effects of verapamil.

There is some evidence that the extract could improve the myocardial performance by modulating the function of cardiac conduction system, as the PR interval is prolonged by the extract. The possibility that the extract could act on the cellular level, i.e., on the calcium transport, cannot be ruled out.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ALESSE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ALESSE is based on the induction of a tolerogenic state in CD4+ T cells by T-cell receptor (TCR) signal-dependent engagement of FcγRIIB, a negative regulator of T-cell activation. The tolerogenic response was achieved by the secretion of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-35. As a result, T cells were converted into IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. In a previous study, we showed that the tolerogenic effect of ALESSE in vivo is restricted to antigen-specific T cells. We have now developed an ex vivo human assay for ALESSE, which allows us to analyze the in vitro effect of ALESSE on polyclonal human CD4+ T cells. ALESSE significantly induced IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells stimulated with CD3 and CD28 antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, IL-10 secretion was dependent on the dose

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Alfacalcidol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Alfacalcidol is not fully understood. Alfacalcidol acts as a potent vitamin D metabolite, with effects similar to those of 1,25(OH)2D3. It is hydroxylated in the liver and then in the kidney. In the kidney, alfacalcidol is converted into the active form 1,25(OH)2D3 by the action of vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.

For the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, alfacalcidol is used for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency. For this indication, alfacalcidol is administered orally in a dose of 0.5 μg once a day.

Adverse reactions:

Hypocalcemia may occur.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Alfuzosin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Alfuzosin is not fully understood. However, it is believed to be related to a reduction in the binding of the smooth muscle alpha-adrenergic receptor by the catecholamine. The smooth muscle alpha-adrenergic receptor mediates contractions in response to sympathetic stimulation. It has been suggested that the mechanism of action of Alfuzosin may be a direct action on the smooth muscle cell membrane. Alfuzosin may also act as an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist in the central nervous system.

2.1 Dosage

The recommended dose of Alfuzosin is 10 mg once daily in the morning, taken with or without food. The dosage should be adjusted based on the individual patient's response. The dose should be reduced to 10 mg once daily if there is no response after one week. The dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily if needed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Aliskiren is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Aliskiren is similar to that of Renin Inhibitors (RIs). It blocks the conversion of Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang I) which is the first and rate limiting step of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). In the RAAS, renin acts on Ang I to produce Angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II is an octapeptide with 2 vasoconstrictor (Vaso) and 2 angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors (R) \[[@B1]\].

Ang II binds to the AT1 receptor which activates various pathways which lead to increased aldosterone, vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction \[[@B2]\]. Aliskiren has been shown to have potent antihypertensive effects with a decrease in Ang II levels \[[

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ALLERNAZE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ALLERNAZE is currently unknown. It is a “non-immunogenic” (i.e., not derived from a human or animal source) preparation. It is not known whether ALLERNAZE acts directly on the mucosal immune system or through stimulation of the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The results of clinical studies to date have shown that ALLERNAZE has a good safety profile and does not cause local or systemic side effects. In addition, there is evidence that ALLERNAZE can induce a clinically relevant reduction in IgE levels.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ALLI is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ALLI is based on the binding of a molecule to a receptor site, which leads to the formation of a receptor-ALLI complex. The receptor-ALLI complex, by altering the balance of key intracellular signaling pathways, alters the transcription of genes that regulate growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. This results in the death of cancer cells.

Pharmacokinetics

ALLI is orally bioavailable in animals. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.

Elimination
ALLI is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to form the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.

Toxicology
ALLI is toxic in animals and has been shown to be toxic in vitro. It has also been shown to be mutagenic and clastogenic in vitro.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Allopregnanolone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Allopregnanolone is based on its ability to enhance GABA~A~ receptor-mediated neurotransmission, and consequently to inhibit excitatory transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) ([@B2]). In addition, Allopregnanolone may have direct or indirect effects on the glutamatergic system by increasing the expression of glutamate transporter proteins and reducing glutamate levels ([@B4]). Allopregnanolone acts at a number of levels in the CNS to produce its physiological effects ([@B9]). It can also influence the metabolism of other neurosteroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone ([@B7]). It has been suggested that this effect is mediated through the interaction of Allopregnanolone with GABA~A~ receptors ([@B5]). In the brain, the concentrations of Allopregnanolone are low, and the main site of action of this neurosteroid is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amantadine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amantadine is unclear. Its effect may be attributed to its interaction with glutamate-gated channels or its action as a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It may also have an effect on the glutamatergic pathway that is independent of its action on the NMDA receptor. This is indicated by the fact that amantadine can block certain manifestations of disease that are not mediated by the NMDA receptor, such as the development of epilepsy, and that this effect does not occur in patients who are not treated with the drug. The fact that amantadine also has an effect on dopamine receptors, probably explains why it is effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Amantadine has a dose-related toxicity, particularly at higher doses. At therapeutic doses, the side effects are usually mild and transient. However, in overdose the side effects may be severe, and include, among others, seizures, tachycardia, hallucinations, confusion

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amikacin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amikacin is still not completely understood, but it is known that the antibiotic inhibits the synthesis of proteins and inhibits the activity of the enzyme peptidyl transferase.

The activity of the kidneys is not affected, but Amikacin can cause significant accumulation of the drug in the biliary tract, which can lead to biliary tract damage. This is one of the side effects of the drug.

Toxicity

The most common side effects of Amikacin are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The ototoxicity is usually reversible, and if the treatment is stopped, the hearing usually returns to normal.

In severe cases of ototoxicity, Amikacin may lead to deafness. The nephrotoxicity is less common and can lead to significant decrease in kidney function. This is more likely to occur if the patient is also suffering from kidney disease.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AMINOCAPROIC is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AMINOCAPROIC is not completely understood. However, the hypothesis of its mechanism of action has been recently advanced by researchers of the Department of Neuroscience of the Medical School of the University of Salamanca, Spain. These authors suggest that AMINOCAPROIC is a "probiotic" substance that is able to act on the olfactory mucosa, which is a highly specialized structure that forms the epithelium of the nasal cavity, and also to act on the trigeminal ganglion, the central nervous system (CNS) region that is involved in the sense of smell and the sense of taste. The authors also hypothesize that the beneficial effect of AMINOCAPROIC may be due to the stimulation of neurogenesis in the olfactory mucosa and the trigeminal ganglion.

The hypothesis of the mechanism of action of AMINOCAPROIC is based on the following facts:

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Aminoglutethimide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Aminoglutethimide is based on its interference with the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. This interference is effected through the inhibition of 5α-reductase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Aminoglutethimide is given by mouth and is generally well tolerated. Its main side effects are mild to moderate headache, nausea, vomiting, and breast tenderness. Less common side effects include sweating, arthralgia, diarrhea, rash, and changes in hair and skin color. Because of its side effects, it is usually discontinued when the response to treatment has been observed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amitriptyline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amitriptyline is still not fully understood. The clinical efficacy of Amitriptyline is probably related to the modulation of serotonin receptors. A modulator of serotonin receptors is not involved in the antidepressant mechanism of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A study of the receptor binding profiles of Amitriptyline and the SSRI fluoxetine in a mouse model showed that both drugs are inhibitors of 5-HT2C and 5-HT7 receptors (Puri, P., et al., Proc. Natl.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amlodipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amlodipine is not well understood. One of the mechanisms of action may be via its effect on calcium ion transport across cell membranes. Amlodipine inhibits the entry of calcium ions across the membranes of smooth muscle cells and, therefore, may reduce the force of the contractions of the smooth muscle cells. Another mechanism of action may be via its effect on calcium ion transport across cardiac muscle cell membranes.

Amlodipine can cause hypotension in a dose-dependent manner. Hypotension is usually dose-related and is more frequent at the beginning of treatment. The hypotensive effect is related to the dose, and a daily dose of 5 mg or less is considered to be safe. In some patients, the hypotensive effect of Amlodipine can be transient and of limited duration. This is usually associated with a reduction in the dose of Amlodipine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AMLODIPINE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AMLODIPINE is not known, but is believed to be the result of its antagonistic action at peripheral adrenergic receptors, its negative inotropic action on the myocardium, and/or a direct effect on calcium channels. AMLODIPINE is an effective antihypertensive agent. When given alone, it lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is also useful as an adjunct to other antihypertensive agents. The recommended dosage is 5 mg orally once a day, or 2.5 mg orally twice a day. AMLODIPINE is administered once a day, or 2.5 mg orally twice a day, for initial treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ammonium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ammonium is complex. It is reported to activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), an important regulator of cell growth and protein synthesis. This results in increased protein synthesis and cell growth. It is also reported to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), resulting in an increased phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including AKT and eIF2B. The increase in phosphorylation of AKT inhibits the activation of protein synthesis and the inhibitory effect on eIF2B results in an increase in the formation of eIF2-GTP-tRNAi^Met^ complex. This complex is then able to enter the ribosome and bind to the initiation codon, thus stimulating translation initiation. Ammonium also has a variety of other effects including stimulation of MAPK, Wnt, and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Ammonium has been shown to be beneficial in a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amodiaquin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amodiaquin is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that Amodiaquin acts by inhibiting glutathione synthesis, which in turn leads to depletion of glutathione, oxidative stress and DNA damage. In addition, Amodiaquin has been shown to deplete glutathione in cells in culture. Inhibition of glutathione synthesis has also been shown to lead to cell death.

Administration of Amodiaquin can cause liver injury, which can be dose-dependent and reversible. Some patients may develop a type of acute liver failure called acute liver failure. This is usually a result of the drug being taken by patients who have other pre-existing liver problems. Patients who are taking Amodiaquin who also have pre-existing liver disease are at increased risk of developing this side effect. It is not clear if this risk can be reduced by regular monitoring of liver function.

Response: The mechanism of action of Amodiaquine is not well understood but it is known to be an inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. It is thought that the enzyme inhibition leads to inhibition of the folic acid synthetic pathway and ultimately to cell death.

Amodiaquine is available as tablets, suspension and syrup. The suspension is usually dosed at 3 times the tablet dose. The suspension is stable for 6 months.

Side effects
Side effects include headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, cough, chest pain, blurred vision, change in colour of eyes, urine changes and ringing in ears.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of amoxicillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of amoxicillin is thought to be mediated by inhibition of cell wall synthesis in the organisms, as a result of which the organisms lose their viability. It is an antibiotic of first choice for most infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract and skin and is used for prophylaxis in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. It is also effective in treating otitis media, pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia and osteomyelitis.

The spectrum of activity of amoxicillin is similar to that of ampicillin. The mechanism of action is similar to that of ampicillin, and the clinical effects are similar to those of ampicillin. It is bactericidal in action, and as a result of this, it does not require bactericidal effect to be effective. It has a rapid bactericidal action. It is well absorbed following oral administration.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Amoxicillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Amoxicillin is not completely known. However, the evidence indicates that Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by blocking the activity of transpeptidase (TolC) enzyme, an enzyme required for cell wall synthesis, and by altering the function of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are responsible for cross-linking of peptidoglycan and providing cell wall stability. Amoxicillin also interferes with the synthesis of bacterial cell wall, a key step in bacterial cell proliferation and cell division. The PBP-dependent step is the most vulnerable to the antibiotic, and is most likely to be inhibited. The final step of cell wall synthesis is cross-linking of peptidoglycan. Amoxicillin inhibits the transpeptidase enzyme and alters the function of PBPs. The cell wall of susceptible bacteria is less stable than that of resistant bacteria. Amoxicillin induces a leakage of cell wall, which results in a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ANCOBON is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ANCOBON is a multiple-site interaction with key enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism, including HMG-CoA reductase, CYP7A1, and HMG-CoA synthase, in the liver and intestine. ANCOBON's unique dual mechanism of action increases its potency and reduces the risk of adverse effects associated with statin use. ANCOBON also has the potential to increase its efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe hypercholesterolemia, because of its potent inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase.

ANCOBON is not a statin, and is not a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and does not compete with mevalonate for binding to the enzyme.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Andrographolide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Andrographolide is based on inhibition of the protein synthesis of the microtubule which ultimately results in cell death \[[@B9]\]. Studies by the authors have shown that Andrographolide is effective in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer. The efficacy of Andrographolide is possibly due to its selective inhibition of protein synthesis of the cancer cells. This could be due to the differential regulation of protein synthesis in cancer cells versus normal cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Androsterone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Androsterone is through stimulation of the activity of estrogen receptors. This stimulates the activity of genes that are responsible for testosterone production.

In the body, the steroid Androsterone is the male hormone of the body, and is converted into the male hormone DHT.

Androsterone is used in the treatment of gynecomastia.

What is Gynecomastia?

Gynecomastia is a condition where the breast tissue becomes enlarged, causing a breast size that is larger than the normal breast size. The condition may be seen in men, but it is also common in women, who may also experience enlargement of their breasts.

Causes of Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia is a condition that can occur due to the body producing more male hormones than female hormones.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Antipyrine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Antipyrine is poorly understood. Antipyrine is metabolized to norantipyrine in the liver by cytochrome P450 2E1, a form of cytochrome P450. Antipyrine has a similar pharmacological effect to tricyclic antidepressants, and it is thought that it acts by inhibition of neuronal uptake of noradrenaline. In addition, it has been suggested that it is an inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and that it can therefore inhibit the metabolism of dopamine. The pharmacokinetics of antipyrine have been studied extensively, and it is now well established that there is a wide interindividual variation in the plasma clearance of antipyrine. The extent of the clearance of antipyrine is inversely related to the extent of hepatic metabolism. The extent of hepatic metabolism of antipyrine is itself affected by the presence of metabolic enzyme inhibitors such as phenytoin and prim

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AP24534 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AP24534 is currently unknown. However, it is known that AP24534 is a selective inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT~3~ receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor. It is possible that the decrease in locomotor activity seen with AP24534 may be due to the antagonism of 5-HT~3~ receptors on serotonin neurons in the DRN. Alternatively, it is possible that AP24534 may be acting as a non-competitive antagonist of serotonin receptors in the DRN. We have recently demonstrated that 5-HT~3~ receptors are expressed on GABA neurons in the DRN and that AP24534 inhibits GABA release from these neurons ([@B40]).

AP24534 is a highly selective inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT~3~ receptor, with an IC~50~ value of ∼0.4 μM ([@B1]). 5-HT~3~ receptors are widely distributed in the brain

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Apremilast is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Apremilast is believed to be related to its ability to block IL-1β and TNF-α release from activated macrophages, as well as to block the phosphorylation of IκB and NF-κB in these cells. These molecules are required for the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Apremilast is also believed to block the phosphorylation of Akt and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, molecules which are also required for the production of IL-6 and IL-8.
The phosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-κB is also required for the production of other cytokines. NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to inhibitory proteins called IkB. Inhibition of NF-κB is thought to be an important mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of Apremilast

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Apronal is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Apronal is that it increases the intracellular concentration of acetyl-CoA, which is the precursor for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, and therefore increases the rate of fatty acid synthesis. This results in the activation of the SREBP1c, the nuclear transcription factor for the regulation of lipogenic genes, which in turn leads to the increased production of fatty acids and cholesterol.

As a result of the accumulation of these lipids, Apronal causes the cells to shrink and become more fragile. It is thought that this causes the nerve cells to swell, which is why Apronal has been proposed as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. It is also thought to prevent the formation of protein aggregates that are found in some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Arbidol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Arbidol is not fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism of action is that Arbidol inhibits the fusion of the influenza virus with the host cell \[[@B33]\]. Furthermore, Arbidol prevents the cleavage of HA and HA0 by host proteases \[[@B34]\]. It is suggested that Arbidol inhibits the activity of proteases and decreases the activity of intracellular proteases.

In the current study, we showed that Arbidol had a stronger inhibitory effect on viral replication than that of Oseltamivir. The reason for this result may be that Arbidol acts by inhibiting virus-induced cell fusion, and the inhibitory effect of Arbidol is more powerful than that of Oseltamivir

Rifampin inhibits the metabolism of many drugs including protease inhibitors, fluconazole, and cyclosporine. Therefore, the clinical significance of the drug-drug interaction between ARN-509 and CYP3A4 substrates, such as protease inhibitors, fluconazole, and cyclosporine, is not clear. However, given that ARN-509 is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in both humans and rats, the drug-drug interaction between ARN-509 and CYP3A4 substrates may be clinically significant.

The binding of ARQ to these sites causes a conformational change in the membrane structure that in turn facilitates the passive diffusion of molecules through the membrane. This results in a decrease in cell volume and an increase in membrane permeability. The membrane-disruptive activity of ARQ was shown to be closely related to its lipophilicity. In addition, ARQ causes a disruption of the membrane cytoskeleton.
ARQ was first isolated from a strain of Streptomyces scabiei, designated NRRL 486, and was named streptomycin. It is a very potent antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity. The effect of ARQ on the growth

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Articaine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Articaine is not completely understood, but may be due to inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels. Its anesthetic potency is also much greater than that of other local anesthetics, which has been attributed to the unique ability of the drug to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels. Its onset of action is faster than that of other local anesthetics and it is associated with a high level of plasma protein binding, which reduces the systemic availability of the drug. Articaine is a strong depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. The duration of action of Articaine is greater than that of other local anesthetics.

History
Articaine was first synthesized in Germany in 1953 and was approved for human use in 1972. In 1972, it was found that articaine could be used for long-term, repeated nerve blocks in order to reduce the incidence of anesthesia-related complications. In 1977, the first articaine-containing

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ascomycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ascomycin is not well understood, but it is known that the target of Ascomycin is the bacterial cell wall.
In clinical use, Ascomycin is most effective against gram positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Enterococcus. Although it is active against a number of gram negative bacteria, its usefulness is limited by the presence of efflux pumps in these organisms.
For example, some strains of Enterobacter aerogenes have an intrinsic resistance to Ascomycin due to the presence of an efflux pump which allows the drug to escape the bacterial cell. In addition, in certain strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ascomycin has been shown to be ineffective because of the presence of an efflux pump.
Another example of a gram negative bacterium that has an intrinsic resistance to Ascomycin is Acinetobacter baumannii. In this organism, Ascomycin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of aspirin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of aspirin is not well understood. It has been proposed that it acts as a direct inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. It is known that aspirin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in various tissues and in vitro. For example, prostaglandin levels in blood platelets were reduced after ingestion of aspirin. This action was observed within one hour after ingestion of a single dose of aspirin and the inhibitory effect was sustained for 24 hours. The inhibitory effect of aspirin on platelet cyclooxygenase has been found to be irreversible. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by aspirin in platelets results in decreased thromboxane A.sub.2 and increased 6-keto prostaglandin F.sub.1.alpha. synthesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AT-406 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AT-406 is different from that of other SGLT2 inhibitors. SGLT2 is a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestine. This transporter mediates the reabsorption of 90% of the glucose filtered in the glomerulus. SGLT2 inhibitors have been developed to block glucose reabsorption, thereby promoting glucose excretion. In addition to the urinary route, the sodium-glucose cotransporter in the proximal tubule is also involved in the reabsorption of glucose. Therefore, inhibition of the proximal tubule sodium-glucose cotransporter may have an effect on glucose reabsorption and promote glucose excretion. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce postprandial glucose and to improve glucose tolerance. In addition, it has been shown that SGLT2 inhibitors have an antihyperglycemic effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus patients

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AT7519 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AT7519 is still unknown. It is conceivable that AT7519 acts by modulating the function of a known ATR target protein, for example the checkpoint kinase ATR. As AT7519 is a small molecule, it is unlikely to act by binding directly to ATR, and may be an ATR substrate. A small molecule that inhibits the ATR kinase activity could have therapeutic potential.
AT7519 is currently in phase I clinical trials.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of atorvastatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of atorvastatin is the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the first step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins have been shown to be effective in lowering total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs for hypercholesterolemia. Several recent clinical studies, including the LIPID study, have shown that atorvastatin, one of the most potent HMGCR inhibitors, is more effective in lowering cholesterol than the other statins, and has a greater reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Atorvastatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Atorvastatin is described as follows: The first step of the drug is the reduction of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin and other statins reduce HMG-CoA reductase activity by inhibiting the enzyme competitively at the active site. The second step of the drug is the binding of the active drug to the hydrophobic region of the enzyme. After the binding, the active form of the enzyme is trapped in a non-active conformation, which leads to inhibition of the enzyme and thus the reduction of cholesterol synthesis. In addition, Atorvastatin can inhibit isoprenylation of small GTPases, which is the third step of the drug action. Atorvastatin can also decrease the protein level of Ras and Rho, and thus inhibits the cell proliferation. Atorvastatin also

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Atosiban is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Atosiban is to block vasoconstrictor activity by competitively inhibiting the vasoconstrictor response to endothelin. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide with a molecular weight of approximately 21,000. It is the most potent vasoconstrictor known and is produced in a variety of tissues, including kidney, heart, lung, brain, and vascular smooth muscle.
In the lung, endothelin-1 (ET-1) is released from the endothelium, as well as from macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells, in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of atovaquone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of atovaquone is still not well understood, but is believed to be by interfering with electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain \[[@CIT0001]\]. Resistance to atovaquone is generally associated with mutations in *P. falciparum* dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) \[[@CIT0002]\]. In vitro studies suggest that in the presence of low levels of DHFR inhibitor, *P. falciparum* will remain susceptible to antifolate drugs, while in the presence of high levels of DHFR inhibitor, the parasite will be resistant to the antifolate \[[@CIT0003]\]. Mutations in *P. falciparum* dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS) have also been associated with in vitro resistance to atovaquone, but not in vivo \[[@CIT0004]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ATP is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ATP is complex and poorly understood. In addition to its use as an energy currency, ATP is involved in numerous cellular processes such as signalling, regulation of intracellular pH and membrane potential, modulation of gene expression, and induction of apoptosis. ATP has also been shown to regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ([@bib21]; [@bib18]).

The intracellular concentration of ATP is regulated by three major pathways: *(i)* the Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase, *(ii)* the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and *(iii)* the cytoplasmic membrane-associated P2X~7~ receptor. The Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase extrudes Na^+^ ions in exchange for K^+^ ions, thereby maintaining the membrane potential and membrane potential. The Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase also maintains the intr

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Atracurium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Atracurium is inhibition of acetylcholine (Ach) release at the neuromuscular junction. Atracurium is a short acting neuromuscular blocking agent that is suitable for use in both general and regional anaesthesia. Atracurium was developed as a derivative of pancuronium.

Atracurium is a potent, nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking agent. Atracurium has a rapid onset and intermediate duration of action. The duration of action of atracurium is dose-related. A dosage of 0.5 mg/kg (1 mg/lb) produces a 95% reduction in the twitch height of the adductor pollicis muscle in 10-20 minutes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Auranofin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Auranofin is similar to that of other drugs in the family of folic acid antagonists. The most likely mechanism of action is inhibition of de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides in proliferating cells. Since cell division requires a continuous supply of purines, the purine synthesis inhibitors would inhibit cell division. In the case of Auranofin, the enzyme inhibited is dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The tetrahydrofolate is then used in the formation of purines. Because the tetrahydrofolate is the substrate for this enzyme, the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase results in a decrease in the levels of tetrahydrofolate and thus a decrease in the purine synthesis.
The therapeutic effects of Auranofin have been demonstrated in a variety of proliferative disorders,

AV-951 inhibits ADP-induced aggregation of washed human platelets with an IC50 of 0.4 µM, and has been shown to inhibit thrombus formation in a murine carotid artery model. In human volunteers, a single oral dose of AV-951 (10 mg) inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo by greater than 95% (at 3 hours post dose). This dose-dependent effect is reversible within 3 to 4 hours post dose. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers, AV-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AVAGE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AVAGE is not yet understood, but the drug is thought to increase the sensitivity of platelets to ADP and epinephrine and may inhibit platelet aggregation by the activation of a platelet inhibitory factor. The effect of AVAGE on bleeding time in healthy volunteers was evaluated in a dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects who had no history of peptic ulcer disease. The median bleeding time was prolonged in subjects who received the highest dose of AVAGE compared with placebo (3.5 hours vs. 1.5 hours; p = 0.02). No serious adverse events were reported. AVAGE is well tolerated and appears to be effective in increasing bleeding time. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum dose and long-term safety.

Response: The mechanism of action of AVC is unknown, although it is thought to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump function, increase the intracellular accumulation of topoisomerase I (topo I) and decrease the activity of topo II \[[@B35]\]. The increased accumulation of topo I, in turn, results in the stabilization of covalent DNA-topo I cleavage complexes, which ultimately leads to apoptosis \[[@B36]\]. Preclinical studies in human colon cancer cells have demonstrated synergistic activity between AVC and several other anticancer drugs, including etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and mitomycin C \[[@B35]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AVL-292 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AVL-292 is currently being studied in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The AVL-292 Phase I program demonstrated that AVL-292 is well tolerated at doses up to 2.0 mg/kg/day and that plasma cholesterol levels are lowered. AVL-292 has been administered to healthy subjects and patients with hypercholesterolemia at doses of 0.25 to 2.0 mg/kg/day. The most common adverse events were transient gastrointestinal effects and headache. The maximum tolerated dose of AVL-292 was 1.5 mg/kg/day in healthy subjects and 2.0 mg/kg/day in patients with hypercholesterolemia. A Phase I study of AVL-292 in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrated that this compound reduced plasma cholesterol levels by 50% and LDL-cholesterol levels by 59% at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Azaperone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Azaperone is not completely understood, but it appears to be a muscle relaxant. Azaperone is a specific and selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist with selectivity for the alpha-2-adrenergic receptor subtype and is structurally similar to the alpha-2-agonist clonidine. The alpha-2-adrenergic receptor subtype has been found in the brain and is involved in the regulation of a number of functions including mood and cognition. The mechanism of action of azaperone appears to be due to its interaction with the alpha-2-adrenergic receptor subtype. It is used to sedate patients during minor procedures and surgery. The sedative effect of azaperone is mediated by the central nervous system (CNS) and does not appear to produce significant sedation at the levels used clinically.

Response: The mechanism of action of AZD1981 is complex and requires both inhibition of MEK and phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) \[[@B14-ijms-20-00140]\]. The findings of our phase 1 study of AZD1981 in advanced solid tumors and a phase 2 study in advanced NSCLC demonstrated that AZD1981 is well tolerated and has promising antitumor activity in the absence of cross-resistance with erlotinib.

In conclusion, AZD1981 is an orally active, potent and selective MEK inhibitor that has antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors and NSCLC, including erlotinib-resistant tumors. This agent is a promising new treatment option for patients with these tumors.

Response: The mechanism of action of AZD2281 is currently unknown, but is likely to involve an inhibitory effect on the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis, since CXCR4 has been shown to be a direct target of AZD2281 in a range of cancer cell lines [@pone.0107354-Yun1]. AZD2281 was also found to inhibit migration and invasion of H460 cells through inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a process that was shown to involve inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway [@pone.0107354-Li1]. The molecular mechanism of action of AZD2281 on the STAT3 pathway is also not fully elucidated, but may involve modulation of receptor internalization or expression of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway, as observed in other cell types [@pone.0107354-Chen1].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AZD3759 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AZD3759 is through the inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Inhibition of mTORC1 by AZD3759 prevents the activation of the mTORC1 downstream effectors S6K and 4E-BP1. Inhibition of mTORC2 by AZD3759 prevents the activation of Akt and its downstream targets, such as the Forkhead box (FOX) proteins. The FOX proteins are regulators of cell cycle progression, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis, and the inhibition of FOX proteins by AZD3759 could also contribute to the antiproliferative effects of AZD3759 \[[@B65-molecules-25-00772]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of AZD-5069 is distinct from that of other PARP inhibitors. In addition to the rapid and potent inhibition of PARP1 activity, AZD-5069 potently inhibits the activity of PARP2.^[@R8]^ As PARP1 has a critical role in maintaining the structure and integrity of telomeres and the nuclear envelope,^[@R4]^ PARP2 is a possible candidate to mediate the effects of AZD-5069.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AZD5363 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AZD5363 is dependent on c-MET inhibition, and has been reported to induce apoptosis in HCC cells by downregulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. In addition, AZD5363 has been shown to reduce the expression of EMT markers such as vimentin, Snail, and N-cadherin in HCC cells \[[@CR15]\].

AZD5363 is a potent and selective c-MET inhibitor, with a reported half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC~50~) of 3.4 nmol/L. AZD5363 was more potent than other c-MET inhibitors including crizotinib, Tivantinib, and Foretinib.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of azd6244 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of azd6244 is likely to be by inhibition of the catalytic activity of hERG, the potassium channel protein responsible for the delayed rectifier potassium current IKr in cardiac myocytes. A reduction in IKr leads to a prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration, and a reduction in cardiac contractility. In the absence of a reduction in cardiac contractility, patients may experience a decrease in heart rate and/or a drop in blood pressure. As such, the safety of azd6244 for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as the ability to develop an effective and safe dose for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, is a critical aspect of the development of this new drug.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AZD6738 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AZD6738 is through inhibition of ATM and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), both of which are kinases involved in the DNA damage response. This inhibition has the effect of promoting the release of RAD51 and HRD1 from chromatin, which increases the availability of RAD51 to bind and promote repair of DSBs \[[@B46-cancers-12-01034]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of AZD7648 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of AZD7648 is similar to that of EGCG and involves upregulation of miR-200c and subsequent suppression of ZEB1, leading to the induction of E-cadherin and a reduction in vimentin expression.

The role of EMT in tumor metastasis is well established \[[@CR32]\]. In the current study, we showed that EMT is required for AZD7648-induced cell migration and invasion. However, there was no significant difference in EMT marker expression between the AZD7648-treated and untreated control groups. The downregulation of ZEB1 by AZD7648 did not affect EMT marker expression. The mechanisms underlying AZD7648-induced EMT remain to be elucidated. However, we found that AZD7648-induced miR-200c overexpression is likely to be involved in EMT regulation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Azelnidipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Azelnidipine is different from those of other calcium channel blockers. In vitro studies revealed that the binding affinity of Azelnidipine for L-type Ca^2+^ channels was approximately 10 times higher than that of amlodipine. In addition, Azelnidipine exerted its effects via direct block of L-type Ca^2+^ channels. These characteristics of Azelnidipine are distinct from those of other calcium channel blockers and suggest that Azelnidipine may be effective for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders, such as acute ischemic stroke.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Azilsartan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Azilsartan is based on the inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors. It also acts as an antagonist of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors, but to a lesser extent. It blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors and also blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT2 receptors.

How to use Azilsartan

Take Azilsartan orally, as a single dose or as a divided dose. Swallow it whole. Do not chew, crush or break the tablet. It is better to take it at the same time each day.

If you forget to take Azilsartan, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take the dose more than once. Do not take Azilsartan if you are allergic to Azilsartan or other ACE inhibitors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Azithromycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Azithromycin is believed to be via binding to ribosomes in bacteria and inhibiting the enzyme 50S ribosomal subunit peptidyltransferase (PTase). PTase catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between amino acids in a growing polypeptide chain and the 3′-end of a tRNA. The polypeptide chain can be either on the 50S ribosomal subunit or on the 30S ribosomal subunit.

Indications

Azithromycin is used to treat bacterial infections in humans.

Dosage

For children and adults, Azithromycin is given by mouth once daily for 3 to 5 days, usually in a dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Azodicarbonamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Azodicarbonamide is similar to that of a crosslinking agent. It is an alkylating agent which induces the formation of crosslinks between the protein and polysaccharide chains of the mucin. The interaction between the protein and polysaccharide is a reversible one and is broken when the protein is denatured by heat. It is a non-specific protein denaturant which denatures proteins by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. It denatures proteins by binding to the hydrophobic side chains of the proteins. The addition of azodicarbonamide to the sample containing protein causes a partial precipitation of the protein. The re-dissolution of the precipitated protein is usually performed by denaturation by heating. In addition, it is also used to purify proteins.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BAF312 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BAF312 is not fully understood, but it is known to inhibit both Aurora B and C ([@bib23]). We showed that BAF312 inhibits Aurora B in mitosis ([Fig. 5 A](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}), as expected. We also observed that BAF312 inhibits Aurora C, as evidenced by its ability to suppress the phosphorylation of the CPC substrate TEL2 ([Fig. 5 B](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}). We then tested the effects of BAF312 on Aurora B kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay using purified Aurora B. BAF312 inhibited Aurora B activity with an IC~50~ of 15 nM ([Fig. 5 C](#fig5){ref-type="fig"}).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Baicalein is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Baicalein is still unclear. However, it is reported that Baicalein has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects \[[@B19-ijms-18-01991]\]. The major pathways of apoptosis are the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Baicalein inhibits the activation of NF-κB, c-Jun, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) \[[@B20-ijms-18-01991]\]. The MAPK family is composed of three main kinases: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK \[[@B21-ijms-18-01991]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Baicalin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Baicalin is still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Baicalin on lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in thymocytes and also evaluated its effect on other parameters.

There are no available data about the effects of Baicalin on thymocyte. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effect of Baicalin on the thymocyte in order to evaluate the mechanism of action of Baicalin in the treatment of leukemia.

Baicalin has a high affinity to heme, which can effectively reduce the production of oxygen free radicals ([@A7955R2], [@A7955R3]).

In this study, we found that Baicalin has a protective effect on thymocytes. We observed that Baicalin had a protective effect on thymocyte apoptosis. In addition, we found that Baicalin reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in thymocytes

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Baloxavir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Baloxavir is not well known. In vitro, it binds to the RNA polymerase and inhibits the replication of influenza virus. A study in mice revealed that Baloxavir inhibits the production of the cytokine IL-6 in macrophages and inhibits the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the lung of mice. Baloxavir inhibits viral replication and suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is one of the reasons for the reduction in fever.

Clinical Trials 
The US FDA approved Baloxavir for use in the United States on September 27, 2019. It was approved under the Emergency Use Authorization program.

In February 2020, the FDA approved the emergency use authorization of Baloxavir for the treatment of children aged 2 months and older with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bambuterol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bambuterol is not well understood. Some authors have suggested that the drug is an antagonist of the beta2-adrenergic receptor, others that it is an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors in the peripheral blood. In other words, Bambuterol is an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cells of the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, the smooth muscles of the blood vessels and the sphincters of the stomach and intestines.

In general, a drug that is an antagonist of the beta-adrenergic receptors in the cells of the heart is called a “cardioselective” drug. Drugs that are antagonists of the beta-adrenergic receptors in the peripheral blood are called “cardioselective” in general.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Baricitinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Baricitinib is still unclear. However, it has been demonstrated that Baricitinib acts through inhibiting the NF-kB pathway and IL-6. Moreover, Baricitinib increases the degradation of the IκB-α, a member of the NF-κB family.

As the TNF-α receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) has been shown to be a substrate for Baricitinib, the signaling pathways that lead to the degradation of the IκB-α are probably blocked by Baricitinib.

In conclusion, Baricitinib could be a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, especially in those patients that do not respond to other anti-rheumatic therapies.

The Authors have no conflict of interest to declare.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BAY is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BAY is not well understood. In the present study, we found that the mechanism of BAY in inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell apoptosis is associated with the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and the inhibition of cell proliferation through the up-regulation of p27 and p21 and the down-regulation of CDK4 and cyclin D1.

Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that plays a central role in cell growth, development, and homeostasis [@B23]. In many cancer cells, apoptosis is suppressed and cancer cells are prone to survive. The major anti-apoptotic proteins are members of the Bcl-2 family, which consists of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BAY57-1293 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BAY57-1293 is not known, but one possibility is that it binds to the HIF-1alpha subunit and inhibits its function as a transcription factor. However, the possibility of off-target effects cannot be excluded, and a more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanisms of action of BAY57-1293 is needed. The second molecule, AMG102, is an anti-inflammatory agent that has been developed to block the TNF receptor.^[@bib33]^ Although it is also possible that AMG102 acts by blocking the HIF-1alpha subunit, it is more likely that it acts by binding to the TNF receptor.

We demonstrate that BBI608 can significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, with evidence of synergism between BBI608 and paclitaxel in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrate that BBI608 causes cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, and that it is effective in a model of paclitaxel resistance. BBI608 appears to inhibit cell growth and invasion by inhibiting multiple cell cycle regulatory pathways, including those involving p53, Wnt/β-catenin, and MAPK signaling.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Beclomethasone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Beclomethasone is a glucocorticoid, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, a member of the steroid receptor family. This family of proteins includes receptors for other hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, thyroxine, mineralocorticoids and insulin. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is expressed in many cell types including monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, synovial cells, and mesangial cells.
Once bound by the glucocorticoid, the glucocorticoid receptor undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to DNA. Once bound to DNA, the glucocorticoid receptor has the ability to interact with other transcription factors, such as NF-κB, which is required for the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Benazepril is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Benazepril is explained by inhibiting the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), which leads to an increase in the concentration of the active form of bradykinin, which is responsible for vasodilation, decreasing vascular permeability, and an increase in the urinary output.\[[@ref1]\]

Evaluation of urine output in the immediate postoperative period in patients with congestive heart failure is essential. It can be done by the use of a Foley catheter, but it is an invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable for the patient. Urine output can also be estimated by measuring the urine output through a urinary catheter. However, it is not a reliable method because of the presence of a urinary catheter. It is better to measure the urine output in the urine container, which is a non-invasive procedure.\[[@ref2]\]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bendamustine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bendamustine is currently unknown. In vitro studies have demonstrated a complex interplay between Benda-induced DNA damage, DNA repair and apoptosis in both human tumor cell lines and primary patient tumor cells.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are lethal lesions to the cell and can lead to genomic instability, cell cycle arrest and cell death if unrepaired. They can occur spontaneously or through exposure to DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation or chemical agents, and can be induced by both conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to induce DSBs. Bendamustine has been shown to be a potent inducer of DNA damage and DNA repair inhibition. The mechanism of action of Bendamustine is currently unknown.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of bendroflumethiazide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of bendroflumethiazide is unknown, but it has been suggested that the molecule acts by blocking the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter, causing the sodium reabsorption and the reabsorption of water, thereby lowering blood pressure.

While the pharmacokinetics of bendroflumethiazide has been studied in the literature, no information has been reported about the bioavailability of the drug. This is a matter of particular interest, since the formulation of the drug is based on a mixture of drug and microcrystalline cellulose, and it is likely that the presence of cellulose may affect the absorption of the drug. Thus, it is necessary to establish the bioavailability of bendroflumethiazide in order to know the rate of absorption and to design a more effective drug formulation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability of bendroflumethiazide after administration

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BENICAR is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BENICAR is not completely understood.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Benidipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Benidipine is to selectively block L-type Ca2+ channels and inhibit the influx of Ca2+ through these channels, thus lowering the total amount of Ca2+ that is available for release. This inhibition of Ca2+ influx results in a decrease in the rate of contraction of vascular smooth muscle.
Benidipine may also be used in the treatment of hypertension. Benidipine selectively blocks L-type calcium channels in the smooth muscle of the blood vessels and, as a result, causes a decrease in the total amount of Ca2+ that is available for release. This decrease in Ca2+ availability results in a decrease in the rate of contraction of vascular smooth muscle. This vasodilation leads to a decrease in blood pressure.
Benidipine may be used in the treatment of conditions in which relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is desirable, such as, for example, in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome, menopausal syndrome

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Benzamidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Benzamidine is still under investigation. The benzamidine moiety is thought to inhibit the release of IL-1 by binding to the mature form of IL-1 (mIL-1). The active site of mIL-1 is buried in the protein structure and is accessible only when the protein is processed. Inhibition of the release of IL-1 by benzamidine is proposed to occur by blocking the cleavage site for maturation of IL-1. In vitro, benzamidine blocks the conversion of proIL-1 to IL-1, but in vivo it is thought to act only at the point of maturation of IL-1, and not to inhibit the formation of proIL-1. In addition, benzamidine blocks the release of IL-1 by neutrophils, monocytes, and other phagocytic cells. In patients with a high level of circulating IL-1, benzamidine has been shown to reduce

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Benzonatate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Benzonatate is based on the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. As a consequence of this activation, a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential is generated. This hyperpolarization causes a decreased efflux of sodium ions, and therefore an increase in the intracellular sodium concentration. This sodium accumulation can be quantified with the microelectrode technique. By use of this technique, Benzonatate has been shown to cause a decrease in the sodium influx in the frog neuromuscular junction (Giacobino, 1977). In addition, Benzonatate causes a dose-dependent increase in the amplitude of miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) in isolated nerve-muscle preparations of the rat (Giacobino, 1978). This increase in MEPP amplitude reflects an increase in the quantal content of the endplate. In addition, it has been shown that the drug causes a dose-dependent

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Benzylpenicillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Benzylpenicillin is similar to other penicillins. This includes its ability to bind to the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which is responsible for the degradation of incretins. Incretins are a group of hormones that are released from the gut when a meal is consumed and stimulate insulin secretion. Benzylpenicillin prevents the breakdown of incretins, which results in an increase in the level of incretins in the blood and consequently increases insulin secretion.

Mechanism of action of Benzylpenicillin

Enzymes that break down and inactivate certain hormones and neurotransmitters are known as peptidases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bepridil is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bepridil is by the inhibition of the inward rectifier K+ channel (IK) (Gardiner et al. 1988). This causes a depolarization of the cell membrane and a decrease in action potential duration.
The structural formula of Bepridil is as follows:

It is well known that the compounds of formula I inhibit the IK, the main current responsible for the repolarization of the action potential.
Bepridil is a positive inotropic agent and is used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and of patients with acute myocardial infarction.
In the last years, it has been observed that Bepridil, by inhibiting the inward rectifier K+ channel, may induce the opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP), resulting in a decrease of the intracellular ATP level and a decrease of the heart rate. The decrease of the heart rate is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Berberine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Berberine is not well known, however it is known that Berberine increases the number of T-cells in the gut, thereby increasing gut barrier function.

As a member of the Berberine family of natural products, the polyphenol berberine has long been known to exert antimicrobial effects against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens. However, the precise mechanism of action of berberine is not well known. We have used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to study the effects of berberine on the number of T-cells in the gut. Our results indicate that berberine increases the number of T-cells in the gut and the upregulation of Th1 cytokines by these T-cells. The results of this study suggest that berberine could be used to treat gastrointestinal infections.

Response: The mechanism of action of Bergapten is not well understood. In addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of Bergapten, other effects of Bergapten have been suggested including antioxidant, antiproliferative, and anticarcinogenic effects. However, in vivo and in vitro evidence of these effects is not convincing. Bergapten has been found to inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism and prostaglandin biosynthesis in cultured human cells, but these effects are also not conclusive. Bergapten also has an inhibitory effect on the growth of cancer cells. The anticancer effect of Bergapten has been reported in a variety of experimental systems including: human leukemia cells, human colon cancer cells, human breast cancer cells, and human hepatoma cells. In vivo, Bergapten has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain types of human cancer cells in experimental systems. However, Bergapten has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of cancer in humans.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bestatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bestatin is still unknown, although it is possible that it exerts its action through inhibition of aminopeptidases (i.e., neutral endopeptidase 24.11) or by affecting the cellular distribution of dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV).

Clinical Use of Bestatin {#Sec3}
========================

Bestatin is widely used as a clinical tool in patients with advanced malignancies. It is used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs such as Adriamycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, in order to increase the response rates and improve survival \[[@CR4]\]. However, the use of Bestatin in clinical trials was abandoned in the 1990s, because of the lack of efficacy. This has changed with the advent of new chemotherapeutic agents.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BETAMETHASONE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BETAMETHASONE is through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. This binding results in the formation of a complex with histones and other proteins. The complex then binds to DNA at specific sites and the transcription of specific genes is then inhibited.

WHAT IS THE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF BETAMETHASONE?

Pharmacokinetics

BETAMETHASONE is a long-acting corticosteroid. It is slowly and gradually absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and reaches a peak concentration after approximately 12 to 24 hours. It is distributed throughout the body and the major site of action is in the lung. The systemic availability of the drug after an intramuscular injection is approximately 80% and the systemic availability after an oral dose is approximately 20%.

Metabolism

BETAMETHASONE is converted to the active metabolite, 17-hydroxy BETA-METHASONE

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BETAPAR is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BETAPAR is not well understood. It is not known if BETAPAR acts on the central nervous system (CNS), or if it has a direct action on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the cardiovascular and neurological safety of BETAPAR in the setting of its proposed use.

MECHANISM OF ACTION
===================

The mechanism of action of BETAPAR is not well understood. BETAPAR has no known enzyme inhibition, nor is it a direct adrenergic agonist or antagonist. It is not known if BETAPAR acts on the CNS, or if it has a direct action on the cardiovascular system. However, there is a suggestion that BETAPAR might be a partial agonist or an inverse agonist of the histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) enzyme. HDAC2 is an enzyme involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell growth and differentiation. Therefore, the exact mechanism

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BETATREX is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BETATREX is to bind to, stabilize, and recruit transcription factors and chromatin-modifying proteins to the promoters of genes, thereby increasing the expression of genes responsible for cell growth and differentiation.

The effect of the protein-based drugs in terms of reducing the levels of disease-associated proteins is more effective than the reduction of free circulating protein levels, which may result from the degradation of the protein by proteases in the body.

BETATREX has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have received one or more prior regimens.

TRIF is also a critical component of the TLR4 signaling pathway, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and other acute inflammatory conditions. For example, TRIF mediates the TLR4-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β). TRIF also mediates TLR4-induced IRF3 activation

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bisoprolol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bisoprolol is not completely understood. One possible mechanism is that it blocks the beta-1 receptor. The beta-1 receptor is located on the surface of heart muscle cells and blood vessel cells, and the inhibition of these receptors may reduce the heart rate and the force of contraction. Another possible mechanism is that Bisoprolol inhibits the action of catecholamines, or reduces the formation of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic nerve terminals. Another possible mechanism is that Bisoprolol inhibits the release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerve endings and from the adrenal medulla. A further possible mechanism is that Bisoprolol blocks beta-2 receptors on cells. Beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs and the heart.

Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that Bisoprolol has the effect of lowering the heart rate and the force of contraction, and that it is effective in the treatment of ang

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bisphenol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bisphenol is not clearly understood. Some studies have shown that Bisphenol acts as a xenoestrogen by binding to estrogen receptors (ER). Bisphenol can be transported through the cell membrane and then interact with estrogen receptors. Some studies have shown that Bisphenol can also act as an androgen.

It has been shown that in animal models, Bisphenol can cause obesity, infertility, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis.

Toxicology

Doses of Bisphenol A are extremely low and well below those known to be harmful to humans. The maximum daily dose for a 70 kg adult is 5 micrograms (5,000,000 times lower than the recommended maximum dose of 5 milligrams).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bithionol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bithionol is similar to other quinones such as the anticancer drug Mitomycin C, which also requires reduction to an alkylating species before it can act. The major advantage of Bithionol over Mitomycin C is that Bithionol is more stable in the presence of oxygen, and thus, Bithionol may be effective against cells that are rapidly dividing. It has been found that Bithionol can be used to inhibit cancer cell growth, including cancer cells resistant to other cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.
Bithionol is a bioreductive alkylating agent that is capable of damaging both DNA and RNA, and is currently being evaluated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. It is currently under investigation in the treatment of brain tumors and in combination with a variety of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of lung cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bivalirudin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bivalirudin is unique and different from all other anticoagulants. The anticoagulant action of heparin is mediated by inhibition of thrombin. Thrombin is a serine protease that is produced by a limited number of cell types, primarily the hepatocytes and the endothelial cells. Thrombin plays a central role in the coagulation cascade. The coagulation cascade is a series of reactions by which blood coagulates. The cascade includes the activation of the coagulation factors VII, VIII, IX, X and XI by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. The activated factors IXa and Xa activate prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin in turn converts fibrinogen to fibrin. The fibrin formed is converted to insoluble fibrin by the action of the factor XIIIa-fibrinogen complex. The insoluble f

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BLZ945 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BLZ945 is currently unknown. Based on previous work, we speculate that BLZ945 may have effects on lipid metabolism. For example, when HepG2 cells were treated with a fatty acid synthase inhibitor (FASNi) and a ceramide synthase inhibitor (CerSi), the cells showed lower cell proliferation and were more susceptible to apoptosis \[[@B38-molecules-24-00990]\]. We speculate that the combination of FASNi and CerSi might enhance the effect of BLZ945. We also speculate that BLZ945 may induce autophagy in hepatoma cells, but further studies are needed to confirm this. In addition, BLZ945 may act on other targets such as β-catenin, Akt, and mTOR, but we do not have any evidence to confirm these hypotheses.

3.2. Nanobody-Based Immunotherapy {#sec3dot2-cancers-12-01168}
---------------------------------

Nanobodies are camelid-derived immunoglobulin G-like molecules that are structurally similar to conventional antibodies. Due to their small size (\~15 kDa) and ability to recognize antigens in a similar manner to conventional antibodies, nanobodies are attractive for use as therapeutic agents. A range of nanobodies that target multiple oncogenic signaling pathways have been developed for clinical use. The development of nanobodies as cancer immunotherapies was initially driven by the concept of "magic bullet" therapy, in which a single nanobody could be targeted to a specific tumor cell population. This concept was based on a series of preclinical studies demonstrating that nanobodies can specifically recognize

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bosentan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bosentan is currently unknown. It is not an endothelin receptor antagonist. It may inhibit endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction and increase vascular permeability. It may also inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Mechanism of action

Endothelin is a peptide with a strong vasoconstrictor effect. Endothelin-1 is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Endothelin receptor antagonists are believed to have beneficial effects in these conditions.

Mechanism of action

Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist. Endothelin receptor antagonists block the action of endothelin-1 on endothelin receptors. Endothelin receptor antagonists may be more specific than other endothelin receptor antagonists. Endothelin receptor antagonists may be used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Brimonidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Brimonidine is not clear. It is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is widely used in the treatment of open angle glaucoma. It acts as a selective agonist for alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It is used as an ophthalmic solution. It is also used in the treatment of glaucoma.

Mechanism of action

When used as a topical ophthalmic solution, it is believed that the primary action of brimonidine is mediated by a local decrease in aqueous humor production.

The decrease in aqueous humor production results in a decrease in intraocular pressure.

Another proposed mechanism of action is the inhibition of ciliary muscle contraction.

Pharmacokinetics

Brimonidine has been found to have a half-life of 2.5 hours.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Brucine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Brucine is not completely clear, but is thought to be based on an anti-inflammatory mechanism and inhibition of NF-κB activation ([@b12-ijmm-40-03-0814]). NF-κB is a transcription factor that is constitutively active in various cell types, and plays a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune response ([@b16-ijmm-40-03-0814],[@b17-ijmm-40-03-0814]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Budesonide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Budesonide is by inhibition of the phosphodiesterase enzyme. This inhibition causes the accumulation of intracellular cAMP, and leads to the subsequent induction of many genes, which in turn lead to the release of many anti-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines, in turn, help to inhibit the release of many other inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of the migration of the immune cells into the site of inflammation.

Budesonide can be given as an inhaled aerosol or oral tablet.

Adverse effects

Local irritation of the mouth, throat, and lungs may occur, as well as a decrease in the effectiveness of the immune system.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bufexamac is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bufexamac is still unknown, but there are several plausible mechanisms of action. The drug is a PDE inhibitor that increases the availability of cAMP in the cell. This can activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and/or cAMP-dependent protein phosphatase (PP2A), resulting in an increased rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cellular proteins. Bufexamac can also inhibit phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cAMP, thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP in the cell. Finally, the drug can block the hydrolysis of cAMP by adenylate cyclase.

Bufexamac is structurally related to rolipram, a drug that was withdrawn from the market due to side effects, such as gastric ulceration and other gastrointestinal disorders.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Buflomedil is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Buflomedil is unknown. In the light of its effects on red cell aggregation, Buflomedil could be expected to have an anti-thrombotic effect, which may account for its reported therapeutic benefit in cerebrovascular disorders. However, in clinical trials, Buflomedil has failed to show a significant reduction in cerebrovascular morbidity or mortality, which suggests that the anti-thrombotic effect is probably not sufficient to justify the considerable side-effects associated with Buflomedil.
The efficacy of Buflomedil as a diuretic is not clear, although it has been reported to produce a modest increase in urine output and an associated increase in renal blood flow. In animal studies, Buflomedil has been shown to cause a fall in the systemic arterial blood pressure, to reduce cardiac output and cardiac stroke volume and to decrease total peripheral resistance.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bumetanide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bumetanide is by inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase, a sodium pump, which decreases the reabsorption of Na+ in the loop of Henle and, therefore, decreases the volume of the tubular fluid in the loop of Henle. In the case of Diabetes insipidus, the condition results from lack of response to the hormone antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to the kidney to decrease the reabsorption of Na+ in the loop of Henle and, therefore, the reabsorption of Na+ is decreased and the urine is dilute. In the case of Bartter's syndrome, the condition results from decreased activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which decreases the reabsorption of Na+ in the loop of Henle and, therefore, the reabsorption of Na+ is decreased and the urine is dilute.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Bupivacaine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Bupivacaine is based on a voltage-gated sodium channel blockade which affects the transmission of nerve impulses. However, there are a few cases where Bupivacaine did not show the expected effect, which has led to the discovery of other mechanisms of action.

In the past, there have been a few cases where a patient received Bupivacaine, but did not feel the expected effect. This was thought to be because of the formation of a non-specific complex with cholinergic receptors, which could have been formed in the presence of anesthetic adjuvants such as a beta-adrenergic agonist, an NMDA antagonist, or an opioid antagonist.\[[@ref1][@ref2]\]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Butoconazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Butoconazole is as follows:



It inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and causes the formation of cholestanol. Cholestanol is a cholesterol derivative which is excreted in the bile. The drug does not affect the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. It increases the absorption of cholesterol from the intestinal tract.



In the liver, cholesterol is converted to bile acids which are secreted in the bile. Bile acids help in the digestion of fats and are excreted in the bile.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Butylated is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Butylated isothiocyanate (BITC) is still unclear. We studied the effects of BITC on cell cycle and apoptosis in A549 cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation. BITC induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. BITC treatment increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and decreased expression of Bcl-2. BITC-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were significantly reversed by treatment with caspase-3 and caspase-9 inhibitors. These results suggest that BITC induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells via the caspase-dependent pathway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Butylscopolamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Butylscopolamine is not well understood. However, its potential role as a selective peripheral muscarinic antagonist is suggested by its marked ability to block acetylcholine induced responses at peripheral sites such as the vas deferens, uterus, trachea, and salivary glands. In the guinea pig vas deferens, butylscopolamine antagonized the contractile response to acetylcholine (0.1-10.0 microM) without affecting the response to potassium. The dose-response curves for acetylcholine and for KCl were shifted to the right in a parallel fashion. This indicates that butylscopolamine does not act by an indirect mechanism. The sensitivity of the response to acetylcholine was also reduced by the drug. The results suggest that butylscopolamine acts at a peripheral site.

Muscarinic receptors are classified into two subtypes: M1 and M2.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of BYL-719 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of BYL-719 is different from other PI3K inhibitors, such as LY294002, GDC-0941, and BKM120. BYL-719 inhibits the kinase activity of PI3K and is a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor \[[@CR10]\].

Our study showed that BYL-719 inhibited the growth of glioma cells, and we also confirmed that the anti-proliferative effect of BYL-719 is correlated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cabozantinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cabozantinib is dependent on the inhibition of MET, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. This inhibition blocks downstream signaling, which in turn leads to inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Cabozantinib is also an inhibitor of VEGFR-2, RET, AXL, and KIT, although its role in inhibition of these receptors is not as well understood.[@b23-ott-9-3603]

Cabozantinib has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC.

Response: The mechanism of action of Caffeic is known to be attributed to the inhibition of COX-2 and the subsequent inhibition of prostaglandin E2. Caffeic acid has also been shown to inhibit in vitro matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other metalloproteinases, including MMP-2, MMP-9, and the membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP). Caffeic acid has been shown to inhibit MMP-9 activity by blocking the binding of proMMP-9 to its activator, MT1-MMP.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CAL-1011 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CAL-1011 is different from that of VPA, which induces autophagy and apoptosis through inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) \[[@CR32]\]. However, whether VPA also inhibits miR-124 in U87 cells remains unknown. We detected that VPA could not induce miR-124 expression, but the effect of CAL-1011 was almost the same as that of VPA in U87 cells. These data suggest that miR-124 could be induced by CAL-1011 and VPA through different mechanisms in U87 cells. It is possible that miR-124 is induced by CAL-1011 and VPA through different pathways in different cells.

We found that CAL-1011 induced miR-124 expression by inhibiting HDACs. The effect of CAL-1011 was much stronger than that of VPA in U87 cells. Furthermore, we also found that

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Calcitriol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Calcitriol is not known. Recent evidence suggests that Calcitriol increases the production of pre-B cells, which are B cells that have not yet undergone a process of antigen-induced differentiation. Calcitriol treatment also enhances the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. This has led to speculation that Calcitriol might stimulate antibody production in some forms of leukemia. There are two main types of leukemia: acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which is characterized by the overproduction of white blood cells, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by the overproduction of cells of the myeloid series (i.e., granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages). AML is a malignant cancer of the blood-forming tissues. It is one of the most common forms of leukemia, and it is also the most rapidly fatal of the blood cancers. AML is also called acute myeloid

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of calcium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of calcium is diverse and complex. Although calcium is involved in many essential biological processes, it is also implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer, osteoporosis, and kidney stone disease.

The present study provides evidence that calcium can promote the invasion of breast cancer cells through the inhibition of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). This study is the first to report the mechanism of calcium in the invasion of breast cancer cells and suggests that calcium supplementation may be a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Camostat is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Camostat is still not completely understood. However, it is known that it has an effect on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and also reduces the synthesis of leukotrienes.

Adverse events associated with the use of Camostat are mild and transient. These include gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain), headache, rash, urticaria, pruritus, dizziness, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, dizziness, and other events. There are rare reports of serious side effects such as liver dysfunction, and death.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of camylofine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of camylofine is not yet fully understood, but the main effects seem to be mediated by central nervous system (CNS) adenosine receptors and to have a central sedative and anticonvulsant action.

In the literature, there are many cases in which sedative-hypnotics are prescribed to relieve symptoms of anxiety or depression, and nocturnal enuresis in children.

The use of these drugs is particularly frequent in pediatric age.

Adenosine receptors are a group of G-protein-coupled receptors that bind adenosine, a nucleoside that has a wide range of physiological actions.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Canagliflozin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Canagliflozin is to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys. It also reduces glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. It has a neutral effect on glucose absorption from the small intestine.

SGLT2 inhibitors are orally active agents that increase urinary glucose excretion. The rate of glucose reabsorption in the kidneys is the primary determinant of the plasma glucose concentration.

The kidneys excrete the filtered glucose via the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the renal tubules, it can be used to synthesize glucose in the liver, and can be excreted in the urine. When the renal tubules are unable to reabsorb the filtered glucose, it is excreted in the urine. SGLT2 inhibitors are designed to increase urinary glucose excretion by blocking the re

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Capecitabine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Capecitabine is similar to that of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors. However, there are significant differences between these two agents. 5-FU is a prodrug that requires enzymatic conversion to its active form, 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-FUTP), in order to exert its effect on DNA. In contrast, Capecitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA and subsequently converted to its active form, 5-fluorouracil triphosphate (5-FUTP), within the tumor cell.

Because of the differences in their mechanism of action, the combination of these two drugs is an attractive approach to increase the antitumor activity of 5-FU.

Response: The mechanism of action of CAPEX is an appropriate topic to examine, as it may be applied to improve the economics of DBS therapy. It is not a simple topic, however, and the mechanisms of action of DBS and CAPEX are complex and may vary by area of the brain. Thus, a clear understanding of the mechanisms of action of DBS and CAPEX in the treatment of movement disorders is needed to ensure a successful DBS program.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CAPITROL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CAPITROL is not known. It is possible that it binds to components of the ECM (e.g., integrins) or ECM-derived proteases (e.g., MMPs) and blocks their activity. This could potentially be a primary event or it could be secondary to other activities of CAPITROL. CAPITROL-induced binding to ECM components may alter cell--ECM interactions or promote cell death. CAPITROL-induced MMP inhibition may also contribute to the loss of fibronectin and collagen by promoting their degradation.

The overall biological effects of CAPITROL may be determined by the presence of an α-helical C-terminal sequence. Removal of the C-terminal helix increases the stability of the compound and reduces its anti-MMP activity. This suggests that the C-terminal α-helix may function as a scaffold to position the

*Mycobacterium avium* is an opportunistic pathogen, and lung infection is often seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly in AIDS. There is little information in the literature regarding the use of steroids for *Mycobacterium avium* infections. We report a case of disseminated pulmonary *Mycobacterium avium* infection in a patient with AIDS treated successfully with steroid therapy. The response to steroid therapy may be due to the immunomodulatory effect of steroids on the immune system.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Carazolol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Carazolol is not fully understood. In vitro studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of cholinesterase, and several in vivo studies have shown significant reductions in heart rate and blood pressure in anesthetized dogs, cats and humans. It is believed that the major effect of Carazolol in humans is on the cardiovascular system.
Carazolol may be used in combination with a vasodilator such as nitroglycerin, or other therapeutic agents such as.beta.-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, nitroprusside, or any other agent that can be administered intravenously or orally to provide enhanced therapeutic effects.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of carbachol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of carbachol is to increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP. In intact cells, this effect is mediated by the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) coupled to a G protein termed Gq. The cAMP produced by Gq is degraded by the phosphodiesterase PDE4. Thus, PDE4 inhibitors potentiate the effects of mAChR agonists in intact cells.
PDE4 is the major cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase in inflammatory leukocytes and its inhibition results in increased levels of intracellular cAMP and thus in increased production of cytokines. Thus, PDE4 inhibitors are useful for enhancing or prolonging the effects of mAChR agonists, e.g., by suppressing cytokine production. They may be useful in the treatment of allergic reactions and asthma, and other disorders or conditions associated with excessive or unregulated cytokine production, e.g.,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of carbadox is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of carbadox is based on its ability to act as an irreversible inhibitor of the amino acid transport system in the cell membrane. This action is based on the modification of the structure of the membrane of the affected cells, resulting in the inhibition of the incorporation of amino acids into proteins. Carbadox has been found to be highly toxic to the liver, kidney, and intestine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CARBAMAZEPINE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CARBAMAZEPINE is unknown. It may interfere with serotonin or dopamine receptors. It may inhibit the enzyme system that converts serotonin to melatonin, or interfere with the reabsorption of serotonin by the liver. The therapeutic effect of CARBAMAZEPINE may be due to inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin in the presynaptic neuron.

Toxic effects have been observed with doses of CARBAMAZEPINE over 1,200 mg/day. Effects may include extrapyramidal reactions, seizures, severe orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and dizziness. Serotonin syndrome has been observed with the combination of CARBAMAZEPINE and MAOIs.

Response: The mechanism of action of CARBILEV is not yet fully understood.

Riluzole is a drug used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and it is known to be a potent glutamate-uptake inhibitor. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is a precursor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

A 2006 study found that riluzole inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels in the presynaptic membrane, leading to the reduction of excitatory neurotransmission.

Riluzole may also bind to sodium channels on postsynaptic membranes. It is thought that this binding is responsible for the reduction of the excitatory activity of neurons.

Pharmacokinetics

After oral administration, riluzole is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and reaches its peak plasma

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Carbimazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Carbimazole is not completely known. However, it has been found that Carbimazole blocks the synthesis of H.sub.2 S from the enzyme cystathionine.sub.beta. synthase. As a result, the amount of H.sub.2 S present in the body decreases, which results in a decreased amount of acid being produced. It has been found that the concentration of acid in the body can be reduced by as much as 50% in the majority of patients. It is estimated that there are at least one million people in the United States who have hyperacidity.
Another disease that can be treated by Carbimazole is in patients with gastric hyperacidity due to an ulcer. Patients with this condition have an increased amount of acid present in their stomach. The acidity causes the ulcer to heal slowly. Carbimazole has been found to be useful in this situation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Carmofur is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Carmofur is the following: it inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. The inhibition of RR leads to the depletion of the deoxyribonucleotides and the accumulation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which in turn lead to the cell death.

The potential benefits of Carmofur include the potential anti-cancer activity in a wide variety of tumors, in particular in hematological malignancies and tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.

Efficacy 
Carmofur has been approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Carteolol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Carteolol is the competitive antagonism of the beta-adrenergic receptor. The receptor is part of the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The beta-adrenergic receptor is coupled to the G-protein, which activates the phosphatase, which in turn inactivates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, thus preventing the formation of cyclic AMP. Carteolol inhibits the beta-adrenergic receptor in the heart and vasculature, preventing the production of cyclic AMP.

Uses

Carteolol is used in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and glaucoma.

Dosage and administration

The usual oral dose of Carteolol is 0.25-0.5 mg once daily. It is taken at bedtime.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Caryophyllene is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Caryophyllene is the modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway is a major regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. It is comprised of three main groups of proteins: the MAPK kinases (MAPKK), the MAPK, and the MAPK kinase phosphatases (MAPKKKPs). MAPK signaling pathways play a key role in mediating signals in response to a variety of stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones, chemokines, UV light, and others. Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway is controlled by MAPKKs and MAPKKKPs. Activation of MAPKKs leads to activation of MAPKs. MAPKs, in turn, regulate the expression of a variety of genes that control cell proliferation, cell death, cell differentiation, cell motility, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (Cobb et al., 1997, Cell Growth & Differ. 8: 309-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Catechol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Catechol is due to the inhibition of the enzyme which is required for the metabolism of dopamine in the brain. Catechol is a dopaminergic drug.

Uses

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is secreted by the neurons of the brain. The main function of dopamine is to increase heart rate and blood pressure, to increase feelings of pleasure and to cause muscle relaxation. Dopamine is secreted by neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Dopamine is also secreted by the adrenal glands and is involved in the body’s response to stress.

Catechol is used as an antidepressant. It has the advantage of not inducing many of the side effects associated with many other antidepressants.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CAVERJECT is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CAVERJECT is not known. However, based on the mechanism of action of other fibrin glue agents, the ability of CAVERJECT to achieve hemostasis is believed to result from the fibrin glue's ability to promote platelet aggregation, promote platelet adhesion to damaged vessels, and facilitate platelet interaction with the injured vessel wall.
The rate of dissolution of CAVERJECT is measured by placing an aliquot of CAVERJECT in water and determining the amount of CAVERJECT dissolved over a given period of time. The rate of dissolution is dependent on the amount of fibrin glue placed in the body.
The amount of CAVERJECT used for a given procedure is generally measured in mL and is based on the patient's weight. The volume of CAVERJECT may vary based on the amount of fibrin glue placed in the body. Generally, the volume of CAVERJECT is based on the amount of fibrin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CB-5083 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CB-5083 is a result of the anti-proliferative activity of this compound through the inhibition of cell cycle progression. Our findings showed that CB-5083 induced a G1-S phase arrest in both A375 and A2058 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the percentage of cells in G1-S phase was increased after treatment with CB-5083. These results were further confirmed by the downregulation of the cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 and the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The increase in the expression of p21 protein, in turn, can cause the inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4. Thus, CB-5083 has the potential to block the cell cycle at the G1-S phase. This may explain the mechanism of the growth inhibition of cancer cells by CB-5083.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CC-122 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CC-122 is still being investigated, but one plausible mechanism is through the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), particularly CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19. These enzymes are important in the metabolism of a variety of drugs and their inhibition can lead to an increase in the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs.

The effect of CYP inhibition on drug exposure can be difficult to predict. The clinical significance of the effect is usually determined by the magnitude of the effect, the number of patients exposed, and the clinical implications. Most patients are not exposed to more than one drug at a time, and the magnitude of the effect may be difficult to detect. The magnitude of the effect is more easily determined in special populations such as children, elderly, and pregnant patients, because of the increased sensitivity of the CYP system.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CH5183284 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CH5183284 is based on the inhibition of tumour cell growth through the inhibition of the Wnt signalling pathway. Wnt signalling has been shown to be activated in many human tumours, including colorectal cancer (CRC). It is known that abnormal activation of the Wnt signalling pathway plays a role in the development of CRC and it is possible that this pathway could be a target for therapeutic intervention. Wnt signalling can be divided into canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, Wnt proteins bind to a seven-pass transmembrane receptor complex and induce the activation of a signalling cascade. This pathway is usually inactive in normal cells but is known to be deregulated in cancer cells. This includes the CRC cell lines used in the preclinical work presented in this study. In the non-canonical pathway, the Wnt proteins bind to a different seven-pass transmembrane receptor complex. Wnt signalling can be

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Chloramine-T is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Chloramine-T is based on the formation of the free radical of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from the oxidizing agent Chloramine-T. This free radical oxidizes the target substance.

The production of the hypochlorous acid from Chloramine-T involves the transfer of one electron and one proton.

The two reactions are

2 Chloramine-T + 2H2O → 2HCl + 2NCl2 + 2H+

HCl + HOCl → H2O + Cl− + Cl

The combination of two electrons and two protons leads to the production of the reactive free radical of hypochlorous acid.

The oxidizing power of Chloramine-T is significantly greater than that of chlorine.

In the presence of biological matter, the hypochlorous acid is inactivated by being bound by proteins or other biological substances.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Chlorpropamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Chlorpropamide is unclear. It is believed that it exerts its effect by increasing the metabolism of insulin. This makes the hormone available to the tissues, which in turn causes an increase in glucose utilization.

Chlorpropamide is available in the form of tablets, oral solution, and injectable solution. It is indicated for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II diabetes).

Chlorpropamide is a commonly used antidiabetic agent. It is also used in the treatment of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. It may be used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs.

Tablets: Chlorpropamide Tablets are available in the dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg. They are administered orally, twice daily.

Oral Solution: Chlorpropamide Oral Solution is available in the dose of 100 mg/100 ml. It is administered

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Choline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Choline is very complex. The most important way in which Choline is used is in the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

How does Choline work?

Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain and nerves. Choline is needed to make acetylcholine, so when you don’t have enough Choline, you won’t have enough acetylcholine.

Acetylcholine is involved in memory, thought, emotions, and sleep.

Choline is a B vitamin, and the lack of Choline can lead to depression, weight gain, and fatigue.

Choline is involved in liver and brain function, so it is very important for liver health and for brain health.

Choline can help you have more energy, improve brain function, and help your mood.

Choline is found in red meat, whole

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CIALISis
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CIALISis a unique selective, centrally acting, direct-acting and oral erectogenic agent. It is the first drug of its kind to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Erectile dysfunction, or ED, is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity.

The mainstays of treatment for ED are alprostadil (Cialis) and sildenafil (Viagra), both of which are PDE5 inhibitors that are administered orally.

CIALIS has been shown to improve sexual function in men with erectile dysfunction of all causes, including vasculogenic, psychogenic and mixed causes.

The approval of CIALIS is based on the results of three large, well-designed, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cilengitide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cilengitide is currently being investigated. It appears to function by inhibiting αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins and by blocking the formation of focal adhesions \[[@B40]\]. The binding of Cilengitide to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins appears to induce the internalization of the receptor-ligand complexes, thus impairing the survival of glioma cells \[[@B40]\]. The expression of αvβ3 integrin has been shown to be significantly associated with higher MIB-1 labeling index, which is a marker of cell proliferation \[[@B40]\].

Cilengitide is well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile. In fact, it was shown to be well tolerated and safe in patients with advanced solid tumors \[[@B41]\]. A phase I study with Cilengitide in combination

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cilnidipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cilnidipine is unique, in that it causes vasodilation by selectively inhibiting calcium influx through L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. It does not directly inhibit L-type calcium channels in cardiac myocytes. Thus, it does not cause the negative inotropic effects seen with other calcium channel blockers. It is the first clinically available L-type calcium channel blocker to be specifically indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Cilnidipine is chemically described as N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-methyl-3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-acetamide and is a dihydropyridine derivative having the structural formula:

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of cimetidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of cimetidine is poorly understood. In a human platelet model, cimetidine blocked thromboxane (Tx) A2 production from the exogenous arachidonic acid substrate (in the absence of other phospholipases). In contrast, cimetidine did not block thrombin-induced aggregation or thromboxane production in the absence of exogenous arachidonic acid. When the amount of exogenous arachidonic acid substrate was increased to obtain a more physiologic situation, the antiaggregatory effect of cimetidine was also increased. However, cimetidine did not affect the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from exogenous arachidonic acid substrate. Cimetidine had no effect on platelet membrane arachidonate metabolism. When thrombin was added to a washed platelet suspension, cimetidine blocked the increase in free calcium concentration. These data suggest that the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cinacalcet is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cinacalcet is the inhibition of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which is expressed on the surface of parathyroid cells, and is responsible for the regulation of PTH secretion \[[@B1]\]. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperphosphatemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications and mortality. High serum phosphate levels can lead to increased vascular calcification \[[@B2]\]. Cinacalcet is approved in Japan for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD who are undergoing dialysis, and in Europe and the United States for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD not on dialysis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cinchonidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cinchonidine is to cause vasodilation of peripheral vessels, and its mechanism of action in reducing systemic arterial blood pressure is mediated by stimulation of peripheral α1-adrenoceptors. The sympatholytic action of the drug is due to the fact that it is a highly selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist and acts preferentially on postjunctional α1-adrenoceptors of peripheral vasculature.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cisatracurium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cisatracurium is not fully understood. It is thought to be a depolarizing muscle relaxant that causes a loss of neuromuscular transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal and the post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors.

Cisatracurium is an intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agent. This means that it will take a little longer to act than the long acting neuromuscular blocking agents.

Cisatracurium has an onset time of between 10 to 30 minutes, an action time of around 4 to 5 hours and a duration of action of up to 8 hours.

This means that Cisatracurium will take longer to wear off than other neuromuscular blocking agents.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clevudine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clevudine is similar to that of interferon. Clevudine induces a high level of the antiviral protein 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5'OAS) in the cells, which is induced by type 1 interferon (IFN). The activated 2'-5'OAS then synthesizes 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates, which activate latent ribonuclease (RNase L) and induce a series of enzymes that are involved in antiviral processes, including RNase L, RNase 2', OAS, and RNase T1. Clevudine has a more potent antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) than IFN. In particular, the therapeutic effect of Clevudine on chronic hepatitis C has been demonstrated.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clindamycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clindamycin is based on the binding of the drug to an inactive form of an enzyme known as PBP2a (PBP2). Clindamycin-induced conformational changes in PBP2a results in the production of Clindamycin-induced conformational changes in PBP2a which leads to the production of the enzymatically active form of PBP2a (PBP2a) ([@b18]). The rate of PBP2a synthesis is controlled by the levels of Clindamycin.

The recommended dosage for treatment of Clindamycin-induced pseudomembranous colitis is a single oral dose of 300 mg (15 mg/kg) administered every 6 h for up to 14 days ([@b18]). In the majority of cases, the symptoms resolve within 3--7 days, and patients can be managed on an outpatient basis ([@b1]; [@b4]; [

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clobetasol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clobetasol is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR) located in the cytoplasm and in the cell nucleus. The former is responsible for the direct transactivation of target genes, while the latter induces the transactivation of GR responsive genes by interacting with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and AP-1 \[[@B13]\]. The first direct target genes identified were the inhibitors of DNA binding and activated protein-1 (ID-AP-1) and ID-NF-kB. These inhibitors are transcription factors that compete with AP-1 and NF-kB for binding to DNA.

Clobetasol is a potent inhibitor of NF-kB, which is responsible for the transcription of genes encoding for cytokines and adhesion molecules, which are involved in the inflammatory process \[[@B14]\]. Clobetasol is also able to activate the p38 mitogen-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of clobetasone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of clobetasone is not well understood. In fact, while it has been shown that the topical glucocorticoid can reduce the inflammatory process, its mechanism of action in modulating immune responses is unclear. A study by Hofman et al. [@bib1] has recently shown that topical glucocorticoids decrease the expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the epidermis.

IFN-γ is a cytokine secreted by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and monocytes/macrophages. This cytokine is the main effector of cell-mediated immunity, activating cytotoxic cells and promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, and it also acts as a regulator of the immune response. In particular, IFN-γ can upregulate the expression of MHC class II molecules, which are involved in the presentation of antigens

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clofibric is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clofibric is still not well understood. Some studies indicate that the action of Clofibric may be similar to that of Orlistat. In this study, a mechanism of action is proposed. This study shows that Clofibric acts on the intestinal mucosa. This action is similar to that of Orlistat, which is a bile acid sequestrant. This mechanism of action can be explained by the observation that Clofibric causes the decrease of cholesterol in the bile, and that Clofibric increases the cholesterol excretion through the feces. This study was performed with Clofibric because the Clofibric formulation is available in the market.

If the effects of Clofibric are the same as those of Orlistat, Clofibric can be expected to have a therapeutic effect. In the market, Orlistat is used as an anti-obesity agent and to prevent cardiovascular disease. Although

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clomipramine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clomipramine is still unclear, however it is believed to be related to the effect on the dopaminergic system. It is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which inhibits serotonin reuptake at the presynaptic membrane of serotonergic neurons. This inhibits the uptake of serotonin back into the neuron and increases the concentration of serotonin in the synapse. In doing so it is believed to reduce the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, thus increasing the concentration of dopamine at the post-synaptic neuron and thereby increasing the effect of dopamine on the neurons. It has also been shown to increase the release of acetylcholine and noradrenaline in the central nervous system (CNS) (see for example the U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,516).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Clopidol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Clopidol is not well understood, but is believed to involve inhibition of histone deacetylase. Histone deacetylase catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones, resulting in a more compact chromatin structure. This compact chromatin structure inhibits transcriptional initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II. Thus, Clopidol is a DNA-synthesis inhibitor and a transcriptional inhibitor. Clopidol has also been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Colchicine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Colchicine is still not fully understood. It has been reported that Colchicine could inhibit the division of cells by binding to tubulin, thereby preventing the formation of the mitotic spindle. Other studies have shown that Colchicine could inhibit the polymerization of tubulin. Furthermore, Colchicine could interfere with the action of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the latter having an important role in the process of mitosis. It has also been suggested that Colchicine could affect the action of certain proteins by blocking the binding of cAMP to its receptor. Colchicine also acts by affecting the permeability of cell membranes. Finally, it has been reported that Colchicine could inhibit the formation of microtubules. Colchicine is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated by the kidneys.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Colistin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Colistin is thought to involve its binding to lipopolysaccharides, the lipid A portion of the bacterial outer membrane. Lipopolysaccharides are generally thought to be responsible for the toxic effects of the antibiotic and for the resistance mechanisms developed by bacteria. The mechanism of action of Colistin involves the interaction of lipopolysaccharides with Colistin and binding of Colistin to bacterial membranes. Lipopolysaccharides are usually located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and contain lipid A. Colistin binds to lipid A and interferes with the normal functioning of the membrane. The resulting membrane disruption causes leakage of cell contents. This disruption is thought to be responsible for the bactericidal action of the antibiotic.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CP-690550 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CP-690550 is thought to be similar to that of other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In particular, CP-690550 is believed to bind to the ATP-binding site of cyclin-dependent kinases and interfere with ATP binding and the catalytic function of the kinase. In addition, CP-690550 has been shown to induce G2/M phase arrest in cancer cells.
CP-690550 is a potent inhibitor of cell growth, as shown in Example 4, and has been shown to have activity against many cancer cell lines. CP-690550 is a potent inhibitor of CDK1 and CDK2, and is active against a broad range of cancer cell lines.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CPI-1205 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CPI-1205 is not known. However, CPIs are known to bind to and inhibit p97, an AAA+ ATPase involved in the dislocation of ubiquitinated proteins from the ER into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. CPIs inhibit the ATPase activity of p97 and the p97-dependent ATPase activity of the proteasome by targeting p97 to proteasome-associated protein complexes, such as the COP9 signalosome. CPIs have also been shown to bind directly to p97, inhibit its ATPase activity and block its interaction with proteins that are involved in ERAD. This mechanism of action would be consistent with the finding that cells treated with CPIs accumulate ubiquitinated proteins in the ER, indicating that CPIs block ERAD.
It has been suggested that CPIs block ERAD by preventing the dislocation of ubiquitinated proteins from the ER into the cytosol for proteas

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Creatine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Creatine is still unknown. Creatine can be purchased at your local health food store and is often added to protein shakes and other products to increase muscle mass. Creatine can be bought as an over the counter supplement or as a prescription. Creatine can also be made in your kitchen with just a few ingredients. The easiest way to get creatine is by using an over the counter supplement.

“One of the most popular natural muscle building supplements, creatine is found in high concentrations in muscle cells. A study conducted at the University of Montreal showed that the effects of creatine can be increased with higher doses. Creatine is also said to help increase the growth of new muscle cells.” — Steve

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Creatinine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Creatinine is still a mystery. It's believed that the drug stimulates your muscles to burn more fat, and that this results in a loss of water weight. However, it also causes the liver to release water, so the drug can cause you to retain more water than usual. If you've ever been to the bathroom after drinking a protein shake, you may have noticed your urine is darker than usual. This is because Creatinine has the effect of making your urine darker, and it can be seen for up to 24 hours after you've taken the drug.

Creatinine is the primary by-product of muscle metabolism. When muscle is used, it is broken down into amino acids, which are then converted to Creatinine. Creatinine is removed from the body in urine. In most cases, the body eliminates Creatinine at the same rate it removes other waste products. Creatinine is not metabolized by the liver, and so

Response: The mechanism of action of CUDC-907 is unique, as it targets a previously unknown molecular target on the surface of cancer cells. Although the precise mechanism of action of CUDC-907 has not been fully elucidated, a recent publication by Sykes et al. [@bb0005] showed that CUDC-907 has activity against hematopoietic stem cells and that CUDC-907 acts via a direct cytotoxic effect on these cells. Furthermore, CUDC-907 induces rapid cell death via necrosis of cancer cells. This effect is independent of p53 status, but requires a functional p53-binding site on the CUDC-907 target protein, CDK7. This binding site is present in all human CDK7 protein isoforms, including p53-binding-deficient CDK7. Sykes et al. also found that the CUDC-907-induced nec

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CX-4945 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CX-4945 is mediated through inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Specifically, CX-4945 binds to CDKs 1, 2, and 7. CX-4945 inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells that express cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 7. CX-4945 is in phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies.

Mechanism of Action

CX-4945 is a small molecule inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2, and 7. It is highly selective for CDKs 1, 2, and 7 over CDK4, CDK5, and CDK6. CX-4945 is also highly selective for CDK7 over other CDKs. CX-4945 binds to CDKs with high affinity and displays cellular potency against the kinase activity of CDKs 1

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of CX-5461 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of CX-5461 is currently unknown. In this study, we sought to identify the major target(s) of CX-5461 and its analogues. The amino acid sequence of NPM1, a major target of CX-5461, was analyzed. Mutations of NPM1 were generated, and the effect of these mutations on CX-5461 sensitivity was evaluated. Mutations of NPM1 resulted in the generation of two groups of mutant proteins. NPM1A/B proteins had a decreased ability to bind to nucleoplasmin (NPL) compared with NPM1C proteins. The NPM1C mutant proteins were more sensitive to CX-5461 than were the NPM1A/B proteins. The NPM1C mutant proteins were not toxic to cells when expressed in the absence of CX-5461. The nucleolar localization of NPM1C proteins was not changed by CX

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cyclizine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cyclizine is based on an active, non-competitive, allosteric inhibition of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). NMDARs are ligand-gated ion channels which allow the flow of cations (Ca2+, Na+, K+) through the cell membrane. The NMDAR is composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits and the NR2 subunits are further composed of NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D and NR2E. The NR2 subunits have a particular affinity for the glutamate ligand and the presence of an NR2 subunit type determines the NMDARs ionic conductance. The NMDARs are involved in a wide range of processes including neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and excitotoxicity.
The NR2A subunit is the most abundant of the NR2 subunits and is essential for normal development of the nervous

Response: The mechanism of action of Cyclobenzaprine is not well understood. There is evidence that it may act as an H1 histamine antagonist, although the binding affinity of Cyclobenzaprine to H1 receptors is too low to explain its anti-inflammatory effects.

Dosage and administration

Usual dose is 10-15 mg/day (at bedtime) in adults. Dosage in children is 5-10 mg/day (at bedtime) for 3-5 days.

Elderly:

In elderly patients, doses should be adjusted based on individual response.

Pregnancy/Lactation

Pregnancy: There is no evidence of human fetal risk when taken by pregnant women at recommended doses. Animal studies have not shown evidence of harm. However, pregnant rats exposed to cyclobenzaprine showed a decreased birth rate. The safety of cyclobenzaprine during lactation has not been established.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Cyclopentolate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Cyclopentolate is by blocking the Alpha-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary muscles. This prevents contraction of the ciliary muscles and thereby blocks the accommodation of the lens. The efficacy of this drug is measured by the fact that it will relax the ciliary muscles in approximately 80% of the population. The remaining 20% of the population is not affected by the drug.

The next drug in the list of cyclopentolate (CYC) is phenylephrine (PHE). Phenylephrine is also a Alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. However, it works in a different way. It does not prevent the ciliary muscles from contracting. Rather, it acts on the ciliary body to make it dilate. This is achieved by the way the drug is absorbed. The drug is administered orally.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Danirixin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Danirixin is not completely understood. However, its ability to suppress both cytokines and prostaglandins in the liver suggest that it may act via a direct effect on the cell. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of Danirixin on DNA synthesis and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 in H-4-II-E-C3 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line. Danirixin at concentrations of 10-20 microM significantly inhibited DNA synthesis in H-4-II-E-C3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibition was not due to the induction of cell death. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Danirixin on DNA synthesis was not observed when cells were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D, indicating that Danirixin did not interfere with DNA replication or transcription.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dantrolene is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dantrolene is well established. Dantrolene causes a blockade of ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle, which results in a decreased calcium release during muscle contraction. This decrease in calcium release leads to muscle relaxation and a decrease in muscle force. Dantrolene has been used successfully in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH), periodic paralysis (PP), and spasticity.
Dantrolene has been administered to infants and children in the United States since the early 1980's, and in Europe since the early 1990's. The first indication for the use of Dantrolene in the treatment of infantile spasms was in the early 1980's. A large placebo-controlled trial of Dantrolene in the treatment of infantile spasms was published in 1990 (Rosen et al., Pediatrics 1990; 86:247-253). In this study, a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dapagliflozin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dapagliflozin is to increase the excretion of glucose in the urine by inhibiting SGLT2, a sodium-glucose co-transporter protein that is highly expressed in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule of the kidney \[[@B26-ijms-20-03004]\]. In animal studies, the inhibition of SGLT2 was associated with a decreased renal glucose reabsorption, and this was considered to result in a decrease in blood glucose levels \[[@B27-ijms-20-03004]\].

As reported in previous studies, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce HbA1c, blood pressure, body weight, and blood lipid levels in patients with T2DM, without significant effects on renal function, including glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin excretion \[[@B28-ijms-20-03004],[@

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dapivirine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dapivirine is similar to that of other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The drug is phosphorylated intracellularly to DAP-TP. Once inside the cell, DAP-TP competes with the natural substrate for reverse transcriptase. As a result, the process of DNA chain elongation is inhibited, and the amount of viral RNA present in the cell is reduced.

It was developed by Merck & Co. (now part of MSD), which was acquired by the French multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi in 2016. The drug was approved in Europe in 2008, and in the United States in 2010.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dapoxetine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dapoxetine is still under investigation. Some researchers have postulated that Dapoxetine binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT) at the 5-HT transporters sites in the brain. This mechanism has been postulated to result in an increased concentration of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Other researchers have postulated that Dapoxetine acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This mechanism is based on the fact that Dapoxetine is structurally similar to some SSRIs such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine. This may cause an increase in the serotonin levels in the brain. Other researchers have postulated that Dapoxetine may act by blocking the reuptake of serotonin, thus allowing more serotonin to remain in the brain. It is also possible that Dapoxetine may act as a serotonin agonist and cause an increase in the release of serotonin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Daptomycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Daptomycin is the binding of the peptide backbone to the ribosome and the binding of the Daptomycin to the ribosome causes a conformational change that blocks the protein synthesis pathway. Daptomycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Daptomycin binds to the ribosome at the decoding site in the vicinity of the peptidyl transferase center and the Daptomycin inhibits the elongation phase of protein synthesis.

The antibacterial activity of Daptomycin is very potent against Gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not affected by Daptomycin.

The activity of Daptomycin is concentration dependent.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Darifenacin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Darifenacin is not known, but it appears to be at least partly mediated by its effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and the genitourinary system. Darifenacin may be an antagonist of the M2-muscarinic receptor, a serotonin (5-HT)2A receptor antagonist, an antagonist of the 5-HT1D receptor, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor. The primary mechanism of action is to block the bladder neck, which allows for smooth, uninterrupted urine flow. Darifenacin may also reduce detrusor contractility and increase bladder capacity. Darifenacin also reduces the tone of the external urethral sphincter and may therefore reduce incontinence. In the bladder, darifenacin may reduce the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that increases the frequency of bladder contractions.

Response: The mechanism of action of DCC-2036 is unknown. A reasonable hypothesis is that DCC-2036 interferes with a signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and/or differentiation. A number of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been identified, including the c-Jun NH~2~-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38 MAPKs, and ERK1/2 (see reference [@bib43]). DCC-2036 did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or JNK, whereas p38 MAPK phosphorylation was slightly inhibited ([Fig. 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"} A).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of DCC-2618 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of DCC-2618 is not well known. As DCC-2618 is highly selective for the α4β2 subtype, it is likely to act by an α4β2 receptor mechanism. However, it is possible that DCC-2618 acts on other receptors as well. In particular, DCC-2618 has been shown to bind with high affinity to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors (compounds X and Y, respectively, in Example 1 of WO 99/51608). The activity of compounds X and Y was measured using in vitro assays, and they were found to be inactive. Thus, DCC-2618 may have multiple mechanisms of action.

The affinity of DCC-2618 for the α4β2 receptor was determined by using radioligand binding assays with [3H]GR113808 as a radioligand. The Ki value of DCC

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of decitabine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of decitabine is not yet clear. It has been postulated that demethylation of CpG-rich regions, such as those in promoter regions, could result in an upregulation of gene expression. However, the demethylation of a gene that is responsible for cell cycle progression in a specific cancer type may also have other biological consequences, such as induction of apoptosis. Demethylation of the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene p16 has been associated with a loss of function of p16 protein, and this has been associated with apoptosis in leukemia.

A number of clinical trials have been performed with decitabine, and this agent has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDS, as well as for CML and AML. The efficacy of decitabine for the treatment of CML has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials, and the response to decitabine appears to be greater in patients

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Deferiprone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Deferiprone is still unknown. Some studies suggest that the drug may be able to block the production of free radicals and therefore decrease the amount of oxidative stress. Deferiprone also appears to be able to inhibit iron absorption from the gut and can bind to iron in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby decrease the amount of free iron. Deferiprone also may reduce oxidative stress by decreasing the production of the oxygen radical, which is generated during the metabolism of iron. It has been shown to increase the activity of ferrochelatase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme synthesis. Deferiprone also appears to be able to remove iron from cells by binding to the protein transferrin. Deferiprone has been shown to have no adverse effects on the kidneys, liver, or the immune system. Deferiprone is a metal chelator and may also be useful in the treatment of iron overload diseases such as thalassemia.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Demeclocycline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Demeclocycline is still not fully understood, but there are some theories that are likely to be correct. These theories are as follows:

1.  [The first is that the mechanism of action is related to a change in the number of “functional” synapses. In other words, Demeclocycline acts by increasing the number of “functional” synapses, which is a subtype of synapses that is most active when a neuron is actively firing. It is known that synapses are made by neurons that fire and release neurotransmitters into the synapse. Demeclocycline would make a neuron more likely to make more synapses. This would mean that a neuron is more likely to make more synapses in a shorter amount of time. This is how the drug would increase the activity of the neurons and the brain would be more active.]{}

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of DEPOCYT is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of DEPOCYT is the activation of specific endocannabinoid-related receptors. For example, the oral administration of DEPOCYT to mice and rats results in the activation of CB1 receptors and the synthesis of endocannabinoids in the brain and peripheral tissues. These effects are consistent with those induced by Δ9-THC. This activation of cannabinoid receptors may explain the anxiolytic-like effects induced by DEPOCYT in animal models of anxiety.

DEPOCYT is a lipophilic cannabinoid compound that is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The compound readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has a short half-life in the bloodstream. The compound reaches the brain within 5 minutes of oral administration.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of DESLORATADINE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of DESLORATADINE is not fully known. DESLORATADINE may act by blocking the action of histamine on H1-receptors, or by blocking histamine-induced vasodilation of blood vessels.

DESLORATADINE may also work by affecting the release of histamine or other neurotransmitters from mast cells or basophils.

DESLORATADINE is a first-generation, nonsedating antihistamine. It is generally well tolerated and produces minimal sedation and antiemetic effects.

HOW TO USE:

Take DESLORATADINE exactly as prescribed by your doctor.

Do not take more than once daily as it may lead to drowsiness.

Take DESLORATADINE at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after eating.

The dosage is usually given once daily in the morning.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Desmopressin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Desmopressin is not yet known. However, it is thought to be the result of the specific interaction of the hormone with its receptor.

Administration

The dose is usually given in the morning or evening, with food or water, to improve the absorption. It may be given with food to reduce nausea. It is available in oral and injectable form.

Mechanism of action

Desmopressin is a peptide analog of arginine vasopressin, a hormone which stimulates the release of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) from the posterior pituitary. The increase in ADH stimulates the production of urine from the kidneys.

The primary use of Desmopressin is in the treatment of nocturia, defined as the need to get up to urinate more than once at night. In this condition, Desmopressin increases the volume of urine produced and the duration of sleep.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Desoximetasone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Desoximetasone is by its specific binding to the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor, which then translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor. This steroid binds to a highly conserved region in the N-terminal region of the receptor (the hormone binding domain), with the result that it interacts with other transcription factors. This leads to inhibition of gene transcription. In addition, it has been demonstrated that Desoximetasone is capable of inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor.

History
Desoximetasone was developed in the late 1970s by Lederle Laboratories, which is now a part of the Aventis Group. It was approved by the FDA in 1982.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Desvenlafaxine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Desvenlafaxine is similar to that of venlafaxine. However, Desvenlafaxine is metabolized differently. It is metabolized by a single enzyme in the liver, the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. The metabolism of venlafaxine is catalyzed by two enzymes: cytochrome P450 3A4 and cytochrome P450 2D6. Desvenlafaxine is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6, and it is not metabolized by this enzyme. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine are not affected by co-administration with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dexmedetomidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dexmedetomidine is via selective binding to α~2~ adrenoceptors in the locus coeruleus, where it activates inhibitory presynaptic auto- and heteroreceptors, resulting in reduced norepinephrine release. The reduction of norepinephrine release leads to a reduction of sympathetic tone, which results in reduced HR, BP and increased cerebral blood flow. The clinical indication for Dexmedetomidine is neurosurgery, e.g. for reducing perioperative stress and anxiety, and it is also used for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients and patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.[@b1-asm-4-377]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dexrazoxane is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dexrazoxane is unknown. Its therapeutic effect is due to its ability to chelate metal ions, such as iron and copper. Chelation of these metal ions inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species and thus provides protection against oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. In addition, it may inhibit the activity of iron-containing enzymes, such as xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. This enzyme is present in many tissues, including cardiac tissue, and contributes to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, chelation of iron and copper by Dexrazoxane can prevent the formation of these free radicals, which contribute to the progression of cardiomyopathy.

Dexrazoxane is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy in patients with malignancies treated with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. It

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of dextrose is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of dextrose is similar to that of other monosaccharides and disaccharides, such as fructose and lactose. Its absorption and metabolism are similar to those of glucose. Dextrose is taken up from the intestine by the same transport systems as glucose, including the GLUT transporters and the sodium-glucose co-transporter.

In the body, dextrose is used for energy production. It is also used to make glycogen, the body's main form of energy storage. When the body needs energy, dextrose is converted into glucose by the enzyme dextrose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it is used to make energy for the body's cells.

When taken in a large dose, dextrose is toxic to the body, causing hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. This condition may cause headaches, seizures

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dibutyryl-cAMP is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dibutyryl-cAMP is not yet completely understood. Dibutyryl-cAMP is thought to cause the elevation of intracellular cAMP by blocking the breakdown of cAMP by adenylate cyclase. The effects of Dibutyryl-cAMP on cell growth are mediated through a cAMP dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates many cellular proteins. One such protein, cAMP dependent protein kinase substrate, is phosphorylated on threonine. Dibutyryl-cAMP has been used to identify genes that encode threonine protein kinases. In a particular cell line, Dibutyryl-cAMP caused the appearance of a specific set of threonine protein kinases. These protein kinases were specific for threonine and were not observed in cells that did not contain Dibutyryl-cAMP.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dihydroergotamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dihydroergotamine is unclear, but it may be due to its ability to block the serotonin-1 receptor. The agent is often used in the treatment of migraine headaches and has a mild sedative effect.

Contents

Dihydroergotamine is a derivative of ergotamine and is structurally similar to ergotamine, but is about 20 times more potent than ergotamine in animal tests.[1]

Dihydroergotamine is used for the treatment of migraine headaches. It is administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Injection is usually preceded by a dose of ergotamine. The intravenous form of the medication may be administered in a physician's office.[2]

The agent may cause nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and hyperhidrosis. The risk of drug dependence is low, but

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dihydrostreptomycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dihydrostreptomycin is similar to that of Tetracycline, an antibiotic. Tetracycline binds to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis. The ribosome consists of two subunits: the large (50S) subunit, which contains the sites of protein synthesis, and the small (30S) subunit, which contains the tetracycline binding sites. Inhibiting protein synthesis prevents bacterial growth.

In contrast to Tetracycline, Dihydrostreptomycin is a cyclic aminoglycoside. It contains a glycosidic bond between a nitrogen and a carbonyl group and forms a cyclic structure. The glycosidic bond is the site of attachment to the ribosome.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Diltiazem is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Diltiazem is via inhibition of Ca^2+^ influx into the cells. This leads to an increase in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP (cAMP) which, in turn, leads to increased levels of intracellular Ca^2+^ via inhibition of the Ca^2+^-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum \[[@B1]\]. The increase in intracellular Ca^2+^ then activates the contractile proteins, and ultimately leads to vasodilation.

In clinical practice, it is often necessary to treat an individual with a combination of antihypertensive drugs. This has led to the use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive therapy. It is estimated that over 60% of all antihypertensive drugs are used in FDC formulations.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dimethyl is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dimethyl isothiocyanate (DMITC) is not fully understood. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of DMITC on MMP-2 and MMP-9, the major matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) responsible for ECM degradation in cancer invasion. We also evaluated the involvement of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in the effect of DMITC on MMP-2 and MMP-9. We found that DMITC inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was associated with the inactivation of NF-kappaB, as determined by the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65. These results demonstrate that DMITC inhibits MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in breast cancer cells through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dimethylamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dimethylamine is still unknown, but its active metabolite, Choline, is known to be a precursor of Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Choline can be synthesized from Methionine in the body. Methionine is converted to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and then to Choline by the enzyme Choline-Methionine Synthase. The conversion of SAM to Choline is catalyzed by the enzyme Choline-Methionine Synthase. The activity of this enzyme is inhibited by Cystathionine, an intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway, which is an important part of the folate cycle.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Diosmetin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Diosmetin is still unknown. One hypothesis for the Diosmetin anti-inflammatory effect is that it blocks LPS induced TNF-α release and therefore limits the inflammatory response. To study this hypothesis, we measured TNF-α levels in the culture medium of RAW 264.7 macrophages. As shown in [Figure 1](#f1-ijms-11-04249){ref-type="fig"}, Diosmetin significantly reduced the LPS-induced release of TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner.

Response: The mechanism of action of diperodon is still unclear. However, the results of clinical studies and animal experiments suggest that diperodon can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote the apoptosis of tumor cells. A study has also shown that diperodon inhibits the proliferation of normal cell lines and has low toxicity, and therefore it is safe for use. It has also been shown that diperodon has good anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects, which can reduce fever. In addition, diperodon is a natural product with few side effects and can be used in the long-term treatment of various tumors. In this paper, the mechanism of action of diperodon, the clinical applications and research directions of diperodon were summarized.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Diphenylamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Diphenylamine is not clear. It is postulated that the electron-rich nitrogen of the aromatic ring, by the interaction with transition metals, might chelate and induce in a non-competitive way, a radical-induced oxidation of the thiol group of the enzyme cysteine, thereby causing the inactivation of the enzyme. In the presence of sulfhydryl-containing compounds, the oxidation of diphenylamine leads to the formation of the covalent bond between the enzyme and the thioether, which leads to the inactivation of the enzyme.

The combination of diphenylamine with cysteine and thioglycolic acid is called Synergism. It is an effective method of treatment in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus and is effective in a higher concentration than what is required to achieve the same result with only cysteine and diphenylamine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dipyridamole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dipyridamole is not completely understood. The main action of Dipyridamole seems to be inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion and may act by inhibiting the activity of platelet cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The role of cyclic AMP in platelet function is to regulate the formation of intracellular cAMP-dependent processes such as platelet shape change and aggregation. Inhibition of platelet cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity with Dipyridamole has been shown to inhibit aggregation and prolong the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins on platelet aggregation. The results of studies with thrombin, epinephrine, and ADP have been variable. Some studies have demonstrated increased platelet responsiveness to these agonists after treatment with Dipyridamole. Other studies have shown decreased platelet responsiveness to these agonists after treatment with Dipyridamole.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of disopyramide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of disopyramide is still unclear. The drug inhibits conduction of the heart by inhibiting the rapid sodium channel of the heart. It is believed that the inhibition of the rapid sodium channel leads to a decrease in the intracellular calcium concentration, and that this decrease in intracellular calcium concentration is one of the causes of the antiarrhythmic effect of disopyramide.
When the patient is treated with disopyramide, the drug is administered by the oral route. The drug is absorbed by the intestinal tract, and the maximum concentration of the drug in the blood is achieved in approximately one hour. After the absorption, the drug is distributed in the body through the blood stream, and it is metabolized and excreted. Therefore, the half-life of the drug is about 2 hours.
In the clinical use of disopyramide, the drug is administered at a dose of 200 to 400 mg/day. However, the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of DL-Carnitine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of DL-Carnitine is very simple. It facilitates the entry of the long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where the cells use the energy from these fatty acids to produce energy. In this process, DL-Carnitine also helps the mitochondria to produce energy. This way, it also helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

DL-Carnitine also helps in the transportation of fats from the liver to the muscles. It also reduces the production of free radicals and improves the immune system of the body. It also helps in preventing the damage to the liver cells.

Response: The mechanism of action of DL-Menthol is still unknown. It is known that Menthol inhibits the action of TRPM8 and TRPA1, which are cation channels involved in cold sensation and are activated by cold temperature. Therefore, DL-Menthol inhibits cold-induced cold sensation. However, it has been reported that menthol inhibits the action of TRPV1 and TRPV2, which are cation channels involved in pain sensation and are activated by heat. Therefore, DL-Menthol inhibits pain sensation induced by heat.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of D-Mannitol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of D-Mannitol is based on the inhibition of aldose reductase and subsequent depletion of the intracellular polyol concentration. This leads to the inhibition of sorbitol pathway and reduces the high flux of sorbitol into the polyol pathway, which is necessary for the induction of the osmotic stress. The drug is believed to inhibit the aldose reductase by a non-competitive mechanism. It is also believed to act on the aldose reductase enzyme by forming a complex with the enzyme and the substrate, rather than inhibiting the enzyme. The mechanism of action of D-Mannitol is not yet fully understood, and further studies are necessary to provide better understanding.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Docosahexaenoic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Docosahexaenoic is unknown but likely to be related to a role of the omega-3 fatty acid as an essential structural component of the cell membrane. Docosahexaenoic may also exert its effect through membrane signaling. A decrease in omega-3 fatty acid intake has been associated with a number of illnesses including asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer, and coronary heart disease.

Over the last 30 years, omega-3 fatty acids have received a lot of attention due to the suggestion that they may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Most clinical trials have failed to find a significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the incidence of coronary heart disease. However, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may have a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and some studies suggest that they may be more effective than other interventions.

The only explanation is that it has an affinity for certain components of the perivascular space and blocks the formation of micro-thrombi in the brain, resulting in reduced cerebral infarction volume and improved functional outcome after ischemic stroke.^\[[@R25]\]^

Previous studies have shown that the occurrence of adverse reactions to a variety of drugs can be attributed to their primary metabolites. The safety profile of drugs is closely related to their metabolites. Thus, in this study, the study of the safety of domiphen and its metabolite is very important. The results of the present study showed that the safety profile of domiphen in the treatment of ischemic stroke is very good. There was no evidence of any serious adverse reactions, including death.

The present study has some limitations. First, this study was not a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. The study was

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dopamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dopamine is not yet completely understood. However, it is thought to act through the D1 and D2 receptors. Dopamine is one of the major neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is released in the basal ganglia, limbic system, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Dopamine is released by the neuron's cell bodies, and it acts as a neurotransmitter in the presynaptic neuron. Dopamine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that act on the postsynaptic neuron. The D1 receptor has a greater affinity for dopamine than the D2 receptor. The D2 receptor is a postsynaptic receptor located in the cell membrane. Dopamine receptor D2, D3, and D4 are also located in the presynaptic neuron. The D4 receptor is the most abundant of the dopamine receptors in the brain.
Dopamine receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein coupled receptors

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Doripenem is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Doripenem is as follows: Doripenem is hydrolyzed to a diol derivative, which is then oxidized to a keto derivative. This active compound is then converted into a double bond, which, through the action of a cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, generates a metabolite of prostaglandin E1. This metabolite, in turn, is converted into a compound that stimulates the immune system. This compound, inter alia, is a cytokine, which plays a key role in inflammation and infection, and it is this compound that induces the biosynthesis of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Doxifluridine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Doxifluridine is the inhibition of the thymidylate synthetase (TS) which is the first and rate limiting step in the de novo pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Doxifluridine has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in combination with cisplatin.
The major metabolic pathway for Doxifluridine is the hydrolysis to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by carboxylesterases in the liver and in the gastrointestinal tract.
Doxifluridine is the prodrug of 5-FU. In the body, 5-FU is converted to 5-fluorouracil triphosphate (5-FUTP) by thymidine kinase (TK) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (FIG. 1).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Doxycycline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Doxycycline is unclear, but it has been used for years to treat various infections and as a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Doxycycline is generally well tolerated, but some people can experience mild side effects.

How does it work?

There are two different mechanisms of action for Doxycycline.

Doxycycline works by inhibiting the enzyme known as Topoisomerase II.

This enzyme is found in the cell nucleus, and is involved in the separation of the DNA double helix.

Topoisomerase II works by temporarily breaking the DNA double helix, so that it can be passed through by other enzymes.

When Doxycycline binds to Topoisomerase II, it causes a change in the structure of the enzyme, which stops it from working.

As a result, the DNA double helix is not broken, and the cell is not able to divide.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Dronedarone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Dronedarone is not fully understood. This is because of the limited number of studies available in the literature and the diversity of studies included in the review. The results from studies with oral Dronedarone showed a greater reduction in the AF burden when compared to placebo. However, the duration of these studies was not adequate to evaluate the efficacy of Dronedarone for the long-term management of AF. The study duration was limited to a maximum of 3 months, which may not be sufficient to evaluate the efficacy of Dronedarone in the long-term management of AF. The main limitation of this review is the lack of information on the potential long-term safety of Dronedarone in the management of AF. Further studies are required to evaluate the long-term safety of Dronedarone in the management of AF.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Droperidol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Droperidol is still uncertain. In addition to its alpha-blocking activity, Droperidol has also been found to possess anticholinergic properties. It is postulated that these two effects are linked, and that the anticholinergic activity of Droperidol is due to its alpha-blocking activity. It is therefore necessary to differentiate between the two actions when interpreting results obtained from patients treated with Droperidol. The anticholinergic properties of Droperidol are not only clinically relevant in their own right, but also due to the fact that they may have an effect on the cardiovascular system. A reduced sympathetic tone is thought to be of importance in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischaemia and the occurrence of tachycardia is a known side-effect of Droperidol.

Response: The mechanism of action of Dropropizine is believed to be related to the inhibition of intestinal motility and to the analgesic effect on the visceral nociceptive pathway. This drug has been approved for use in Japan and the United States, and is currently under investigation in other countries. It is believed that the inhibition of intestinal motility occurs as a result of the blockade of the acetylcholine receptors at the submucosal level. A similar effect is also seen with butylscopolamine. Dropropizine, however, has a significantly lower incidence of side effects. These include dryness of the mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and urinary retention. In addition, it has been reported that Dropropizine has a potent antiemetic effect.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Drospirenone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Drospirenone is similar to that of spironolactone, but is less potent and does not exhibit mineralocorticoid activity.  The action of Drospirenone is mediated by binding to the androgen receptor (AR), which causes the receptor to bind to its cognate response elements in the promoter regions of androgen-responsive genes.

In addition to binding to the AR, Drospirenone can also bind to the progesterone receptor (PR).  This is important because progesterone can cause endometrial hyperplasia and may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.  The inhibition of progesterone binding to the PR by Drospirenone prevents progesterone-induced endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Edoxaban is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Edoxaban is inhibition of the Xa factor of activated blood coagulation. Edoxaban was designed to have a long half-life and a small volume of distribution. It is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Pharmacokinetics
Edoxaban is orally administered as a tablet. It is administered once daily, with the recommended dose being 60 mg once daily, taken with food. It has a plasma half-life of 12.8–15.8 hours, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 2–3 hours after administration. The peak plasma concentration is approximately 30% higher in patients with renal impairment, compared to healthy individuals. Edoxaban is extensively metabolized by the liver, and excreted primarily by the bile as metabolites. Edoxaban is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Edrophonium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Edrophonium is not completely understood. It may be due to its antagonism of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, or an action at postsynaptic muscarinic receptors, or an interaction with cholinesterase. In rats and guinea pigs, Edrophonium was found to inhibit the ACh-induced bronchoconstriction, and in the guinea pig, the response was greater than that of atropine. The administration of Edrophonium also reduced the increase in airway resistance produced by histamine. This suggests that Edrophonium can inhibit the release of ACh from the cholinergic nerve terminals. Edrophonium also has been found to have antimuscarinic properties in the rat. It reduced the tracheal contractile response to ACh in the presence of atropine, suggesting that it acts at postsynaptic muscarinic receptors. In addition, Edrophonium

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Efaproxiral is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Efaproxiral is as follows:

The drug binds to a specific amino acid on the surface of the α1β1γδ glutamate ion channel.

This ion channel is found on the surface of the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction and other synapses in the central nervous system.

It is a chloride channel that is activated by binding to glutamate.

Glutamate binds to the ion channel and causes it to open.

As a result, sodium and calcium ions flow into the presynaptic terminal.

These ions cause the release of acetylcholine from the vesicles.

Acetylcholine then binds to the nicotinic receptor on the postsynaptic membrane.

The acetylcholine causes muscle contraction.

Efaproxiral is used in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN),

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Eicosapentaenoic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Eicosapentaenoic is as follows.

1. Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, is a fatty acid, that is, a molecule containing a chain of carbon atoms. It has 5 double bonds. In humans, EPA is obtained from the food that we eat. It is found in oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring. In the diet, it is usually found in small amounts, around one percent of the total fatty acids in the food. However, it is the fatty acid that has the highest concentration in the human brain.

2. Fatty acids are long chains of carbon atoms that contain a double bond. They are the building blocks of our cell membranes. Fatty acids that contain a double bond are called polyunsaturated. The carbon atoms in a fatty acid can be arranged in different ways. There are 2 ways of arranging the carbon atoms in a fatty acid

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Eletriptan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Eletriptan is unique, which has never been reported in the previous studies. The action of Eletriptan is the result of its binding to serotonin receptors (5-HT1D and 5-HT1B), which are found on the surface of the nerve cells. This binding leads to an increased calcium influx and activation of calcium-dependent enzymes. The activation of these enzymes leads to the synthesis of a neuropeptide called CGRP, which is the neurotransmitter responsible for migraine attacks.

5-HT1D Receptors: The Mechanism of Action of Eletriptan

Eletriptan interacts with 5-HT1D receptors on the surface of nerve cells and causes an increased calcium influx, which activates calcium-dependent enzymes and leads to the synthesis of CGRP, the neurotransmitter responsible for migraine attacks.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ellence is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ellence is as follows:

1. Encephalitis:

It is believed that Ellence targets the abnormal synaptic connections which are associated with anxiety, and it appears to modulate these connections by re-synchronizing them.

2. Seizures:

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 10% of people with epilepsy are resistant to antiepileptic drugs. Ellence is believed to be effective in controlling seizures, as it acts by re-synchronizing and normalizing the neuronal networks of the brain.

3. Chronic pain:

The exact mechanism of action of Ellence is not known, but it is believed to be effective in reducing pain by normalizing and re-synchronizing neuronal networks.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Eloxatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Eloxatin is not completely understood, however, the lipid lowering effects of Eloxatin are thought to be due to a mechanism involving binding to the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. This binding results in the formation of a metabolite of Eloxatin which is a lipophilic, highly polar compound that binds to the active site of the enzyme. This binding prevents the enzyme from binding to its normal substrate. As a result, the enzyme is unable to carry out its normal catalytic function and thereby lowers the levels of triglycerides in the blood.

Indications

Eloxatin is indicated for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia is a disorder characterized by high levels of lipids in the blood.

Dosage

The recommended initial dose is 60 mg of Eloxatin per day. This dose may be increased up to a maximum of 120 mg per day in 30 mg increments.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Eltrombopag is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Eltrombopag is currently unclear, but several studies have suggested that the drug may activate the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) ([@B1]). JAK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed in all nucleated hematopoietic cells, and is activated by several cytokines and growth factors that act via their respective receptors. The downstream effector of JAK2 is STAT5, a transcription factor that is constitutively expressed in the majority of megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors ([@B2]). We hypothesized that Eltrombopag may be stimulating the production of erythroid progenitors by activating JAK2 in erythroid precursors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of EMD is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of EMD is still under investigation. Recent research has indicated that EMD inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, while inducing anti-inflammatory cytokines. It also reduces the activation of NF-κB, increases expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inhibits activity of matrix metalloproteinases, and increases the expression of their inhibitors \[[@CR5]\]. These findings support the hypothesis that EMD may protect the intervertebral disc from damage caused by chronic inflammation.

There is a lot of evidence that chronic inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease. In addition to affecting the pathogenesis of disc degeneration, chronic inflammation is also a key factor in the pathogenesis of OA.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Empagliflozin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Empagliflozin is unique among SGLT2 inhibitors. It increases urinary glucose excretion, mainly by decreasing the reabsorption of glucose from the renal tubules. In addition, the drug reduces the reabsorption of sodium in the renal tubules. The net result is increased glucose excretion and reduced reabsorption of sodium, and therefore increased excretion of free water in the urine. The increase in urine volume, which is a marker of the diuretic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, is likely to be the major factor contributing to the weight loss. It is well known that the anti-diabetic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is dependent on the degree of glycemic control, and that it is reduced in poorly controlled patients.

Taken together, the data from these studies indicate that the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on body weight and body fat are achieved primarily by increasing the rate of urinary glucose

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Emricasan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Emricasan is complex and remains to be fully elucidated. In our studies, we showed that Emricasan can induce apoptosis of MM cells by inhibiting ErbB2 signaling. We found that Emricasan downregulated the ErbB2 receptor and its downstream signaling components in MM cells. Interestingly, we also found that the autophagic pathway is activated by Emricasan. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of ErbB2 in MM cells abolished the activation of autophagy by Emricasan. Our data suggest that autophagy induced by Emricasan is dependent on ErbB2 signaling. We showed that the effect of Emricasan is more potent in ErbB2-expressing MM cells than in ErbB2-negative MM cells. In addition, we found that MM cells with different ErbB2 expression levels have different sensitivities to Emricasan. Therefore

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Emtricitabine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Emtricitabine is through inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Emtricitabine is marketed in the United States as Truvada® and in Europe as Emtriva®.

Emtricitabine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, which is one of the ATP-dependent efflux pumps of the ABC transporter family. The inhibition of P-gp by Emtricitabine reduces its cellular concentration, thereby reducing its efficacy.

There is no need for routine monitoring of Emtricitabine in patients with HIV infection. However, if there is a change in patient clinical status, Emtricitabine plasma concentration may be useful for optimizing therapy.

Response: The mechanism of action of ENDOMETRIN is based on a prolonged stimulation of the GnRH-receptor complex on the cell surface. The hormone exerts its biological activity by binding to its receptor and subsequent activation of the signal transduction pathway. The pharmacological effects of ENDOMETRIN on the reproductive system and other organs have been described in the literature (see, for example, Marini et al., Fertility and Sterility, 55, 709-713 (1991); Kapusta et al., Fertility and Sterility, 57, 729-735 (1992); Karim et al., Human Reproduction, 7, 1649-1655 (1992); and Endocrine Society, 44th Annual Meeting, San Francisco, Calif., USA, Abstract No. 944, p. 63 (1993)).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Endoxifen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Endoxifen is a non-competitive inhibition of ERα. It also inhibits aromatase (an enzyme involved in the production of estrogen from androgens) and is believed to have a direct effect on the growth of estrogen dependent cancer cells.

Clinical studies have shown that Endoxifen has a similar safety profile to Tamoxifen, although it has less of an effect on reducing the risk of developing a blood clot. It has been suggested that the decrease in the risk of blood clots is likely to be due to the direct effect of Endoxifen on the estrogen dependent cancer cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Entecavir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Entecavir is unknown, but is thought to be mediated through a direct interaction with viral polymerase (reviewed in [@bib0065]). Entecavir was the first nucleoside analogue approved for the treatment of CHB, and was found to be more potent than interferon-α ([@bib0055]).

Based on results of several studies that demonstrated a high rate of relapse of patients who failed to respond to interferon therapy, the initial treatment of CHB is usually with Entecavir ([@bib0055]). In the early phase of its development, Entecavir was administered orally and was associated with a relatively low incidence of adverse events (AEs) ([@bib0060]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Entrectinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Entrectinib is related to inhibition of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the EML4-ALK fusion protein. FGFR inhibition by Entrectinib is highly specific to cancer cells and non-cytotoxic to normal cells. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate Entrectinib as a single agent and in combination with other agents in multiple solid tumor types, including lung cancer. The combination of Entrectinib with the MET inhibitor Tivantinib was studied in a phase I trial. Preliminary results demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy. The results of this trial support the clinical development of this combination. In the Phase I trial, Entrectinib is given at the recommended phase 2 dose of 100 mg orally once daily on a 28-day cycle. It is given continuously in the phase II trial.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Epacadostat is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Epacadostat is similar to that of JAK inhibitors in that it blocks the IL-2-induced activation of STAT5 and the subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB. However, unlike JAK inhibitors, Epacadostat can block the phosphorylation of both STAT5 and STAT3. Epacadostat is a potent, orally available, non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of p38 MAPK, JNK, and PI3K-AKT, but it lacks any significant effect on the activity of IKKα/β.

Epacadostat is in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory diseases.

Studies in animals have shown that EPLERENONE also has the potential to act on several targets, including:

Tyrosine kinase activity of the TrkB receptor, a transmembrane receptor that is activated by the presence of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF is an important molecule in the growth and survival of neurons.

Response: The mechanism of action of Eprazinone is not completely understood. One proposed mechanism is the effect of the drug on the activity of calmodulin (CaM) in the rat vas deferens. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that is ubiquitous in the cell and is involved in the regulation of several cellular functions. Eprazinone is an inhibitor of CaM activity. A second mechanism is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This may occur by an inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.

Preclinical data

Eprazinone has been studied extensively in animal models of disease. It has been shown to have anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and anti-Parkinson activity. It has been used in rats to treat experimental models of Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and spasticity. In humans, Eprazinone has been studied in the treatment of premature labor, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and female sexual dysfunction

Response: The mechanism of action of Equol is not known.

Equol is a selective estrogen receptor modulator.

A 2004 systematic review found that, of all the isoflavones, Equol had the highest binding affinity for the estrogen receptor.

However, a 2008 review found that Equol had an affinity for the estrogen receptor which was three times lower than other isoflavones.

A 2011 review of all the isoflavones found that Equol had the lowest affinity for the estrogen receptor.

It is unclear whether Equol is actually an estrogen or not.

Health effects

A 2008 review found that Equol has not been associated with any health risks.

A 2009 review found that there was little evidence to suggest that Equol could be harmful to humans.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Equol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Equol is not yet completely clear, but there are several possible mechanisms. One is that it works by directly inhibiting tyrosine kinase, such as c-kit and c-erbB2. Another is that it stimulates the adenylate cyclase system and then inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which would in turn inhibit c-fos and c-myc. Equol also has an inhibitory effect on the calcium-activated phospholipase A2.

Equol has also been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This is due to the fact that it has an anti-estrogenic effect, and that it also has an effect on aromatase.

Equol has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. One possible mechanism is that it has a positive effect on cholesterol metabolism, and it also has an effect on atherosclerosis. Equol may also prevent endothelial dysfunction.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Erythritol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Erythritol is unique. It does not depend on the absence of fructose in the food, but on the fact that erythritol has no fermentable carbohydrate. It therefore causes the same amount of fermentation in the large intestine as sucrose. The amount of energy required for the fermentation of erythritol is therefore the same as for sucrose, and the metabolic by-products are the same.

Therefore, erythritol does not cause the absorption of any other carbohydrate or the accumulation of any other fermentation by-products. It is completely metabolised by the body and is therefore safe.

**Safety**

It is generally accepted that Erythritol is safe and does not have any side effects.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Escitalopram is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Escitalopram is not fully understood. The main mechanism of action of the drug is the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) by the presynaptic neuronal membranes. The increase in the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft causes an increase in the amplitude of the postsynaptic action potentials. This mechanism of action may be responsible for the increase in the efficacy of antidepressants, but also for their antinociceptive effects.

Escitalopram has a different mechanism of action than the SSRIs. The SSRIs cause an increase in the serotonin level in the synaptic cleft by blocking the reuptake of serotonin by the presynaptic neuronal membranes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of estradiol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of estradiol is different from that of other steroid hormones, in that estradiol can activate intracellular pathways that are independent of the presence of the cognate nuclear receptor. This action of estradiol is mediated by a family of membrane receptors termed G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes. In addition to their role in mediating the effects of estradiol, these receptors have been implicated in a variety of other biological actions. For example, these receptors have been shown to mediate actions of estradiol in the nervous system (Baker et al., Endocrine Reviews, 14:47-64 (1993)), and in the gastrointestinal tract (see, for example, Braverman et al., Am.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Estradiol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Estradiol is mediated by its receptors, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ). Estrogen is an important regulator of mammary gland growth, differentiation and secretory activity. Its effects on mammary epithelial cells are mediated by its receptors, ERα and ERβ. The present study shows that the expression of ERβ is downregulated in E2-deficient animals. In addition, E2-deficient animals exhibit mammary gland abnormalities, including hyperplasia, dysplasia and neoplasia, which are not present in E2-replete animals. The present study demonstrates that estrogen deficiency results in the downregulation of ERβ in mammary glands and that this downregulation contributes to the development of mammary gland abnormalities. The downregulation of ERβ may be due to the activation of p53. This is because in the presence of p53, the promoter region of the ERβ gene is activated and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ethacrynic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ethacrynic is still unclear. The pharmacologic effects of Ethacrynic include a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increase in glomerular capillary pressure (GCAP). These effects result in an increase in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate. Ethacrynic has also been shown to increase the GFR in the absence of increased GCAP and to cause a reduction in GCAP. This reduction in GCAP may be due to the competitive inhibition of the binding of calcium to its carrier in the tubule.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Etidronate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Etidronate is not completely understood. However, the evidence that it reduces bone resorption (osteoclastic activity) and inhibits osteoclast migration has been confirmed in the experimental animal model. It is also possible that it may affect the mineralization of bone, as has been suggested in some human studies \[[@B3]\]. Etidronate has been found to inhibit the formation of new bone in animals, and there are some reports that it may also inhibit osteoblast activity.

In this study, we found that it is effective in inhibiting alveolar bone loss and periodontal disease. There are a number of reports of the efficacy of Etidronate in reducing alveolar bone loss and in inhibiting periodontal disease. These studies were conducted in animals, in which the alveolar bone is completely avascular and the periodontal ligament is present. Etidronate inhibits osteocl

Response: The mechanism of action of Etodolac is not fully understood.

I am now taking Etodolac for pain. I would like to know if the mechanism of action is the same as Celecoxib. I have read that the mechanism of action is the same, but I am just not sure how that works.

Answer:

Dear Eliana:

Thanks for your question.

Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a similar mechanism of action to other NSAIDs. It is not an anti-inflammatory like an anti-inflammatory drug.

The mechanisms of action of Etodolac are well understood and published in many medical journals.

I hope this helps.

Kind regards,

Dr. Sabrina G.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Etofibrate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Etofibrate is to promote the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. PPARα regulates genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and energy balance. It is expressed in most tissues, including the liver, and the activity of PPARα is stimulated by endogenous ligands. Etofibrate and other PPARα agonists are known to improve the lipid profile in humans and in animal models, to increase insulin sensitivity, and to reduce body weight. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,923, U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,370, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,263, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.)

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Etomidate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Etomidate is via the inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), an enzyme that converts cortisone to cortisol in the liver and in many other tissues. Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 increases intracellular cortisol concentrations and thus may inhibit glucocorticoid receptor function.^[@R1]^ Because of the induction of the 11β-HSD1 enzyme by proinflammatory cytokines,^[@R2]^ the effect of Etomidate on inflammation is probably mediated via an increase in cortisol levels.^[@R3]^ Etomidate is used as a preanesthetic agent in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The etomidate dose used in CABG surgery is 50--150 μg/kg and is based on the administration of the first of 2 infusions of 2.5--5 mg

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Etoposide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Etoposide is related to inhibition of the enzyme topoisomerase II, a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA synthesis and repair. This drug has a high degree of specificity for cancer cells, which normally have higher levels of topoisomerase II. The drug binds to the enzyme, trapping it on DNA, and inhibiting its activity.

Etoposide has been used to treat many different types of cancer, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, and many others. It is often combined with other cancer drugs to increase the effectiveness of the treatment. It can also be used as a single agent to treat some types of cancer.

How to use

Etoposide should be taken by mouth with a glass of water. It is usually given by mouth twice a day for 5 days. The dose is based on your body

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Everolimus is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Everolimus is that it binds to the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) which is a central player in the mTOR-signaling pathway that is activated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Everolimus inhibits the phosphorylation of downstream proteins of the mTOR pathway, including the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). These proteins are phosphorylated and inactivated by mTOR. Everolimus also prevents the mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1, and the formation of a protein complex that includes mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1, which promotes protein translation and cell growth.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Evista is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Evista is not fully understood. However, it is believed that Evista inhibits the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) which is an enzyme responsible for the production of inflammatory leukotrienes.
Leukotrienes are biologically active lipids which are produced by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. The 5-lipoxygenase enzyme has been implicated in a variety of disease states including asthma, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and septic shock.
It is believed that leukotrienes are involved in many disease states and it is expected that inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme will be useful in the treatment of these disease states.
As a result of these findings, 5-LO inhibitors have become a major target for

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of FCE28073 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of FCE28073 is not yet known, but the similarities in structure between FCE28073 and ATP analogues may be indicative of a role for ATP in the function of these compounds.

We recently demonstrated that ATP levels in *C. elegans* are lower in the absence of *mdt-15*, and that a similar phenotype can be induced by inhibition of ATP synthesis by targeting mitochondrial ATP synthase [@pone.0072123-Spichak1]. The latter is similar to our results with FCE28073, and indicates that ATP synthesis is a crucial factor in the function of FCE28073.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of FDL169 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of FDL169 is still unclear. The increase in total tumor size observed in the FDL169-treated group was not the result of tumor outgrowth, but rather of an increase in the percentage of tumor cells in the G2M phase. As tumor cells are exposed to increasing concentrations of FDL169 in the S-phase, this compound could induce DNA damage and trigger the DNA damage response, which could in turn activate the cell cycle checkpoints, which would ultimately lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death. FDL169 may be able to overcome resistance mechanisms developed by the tumor cells and trigger apoptosis in the presence of these mechanisms.

FDL169 was highly active against the HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts and against HCT-116 cells in culture, indicating that this compound has potent antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of FELDENE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of FELDENE is based on the ability of the FELDENE molecule to reduce and cross-link hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells. FELDENE is absorbed through the intestinal tract. It is transported to the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and spleen where it binds to the red blood cells and forms a complex which is then removed from the circulation by phagocytosis. This results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells, thereby leading to the pallor observed in the FELDENE-treated animals. The mechanism of action of FELDENE in its interaction with the hemoglobin molecule has been studied and confirmed in many laboratories (Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, Japan, and United States).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Felodipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Felodipine is the selective blockade of calcium channels, with the result that in the presence of Felodipine, the rate of myocardial relaxation decreases. This results in a decrease in diastolic filling and increases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. This causes an increase in myocardial contractility, cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.

Elevated diastolic pressure, decreased myocardial relaxation and increased myocardial contractility, and therefore increased cardiac output and systemic blood pressure are the mechanisms of action of Calcium Channel Blockers.

Felodipine is a third generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and it is effective in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of FENOFIBRATE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of FENOFIBRATE is believed to be due to its inhibitory action on the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a protein that is responsible for the assembly of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the liver and their secretion into the bloodstream. MTP catalyzes the transfer of triglycerides from the cytosolic pool of lipid droplets to apolipoprotein B (apoB) on the surface of nascent VLDL particles.
FENOFIBRATE is an orally active MTP inhibitor. FENOFIBRATE is believed to block the assembly of VLDL particles, which are responsible for transporting triglycerides to peripheral tissues for storage.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fenoprofen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fenoprofen is poorly understood. Fenoprofen is thought to act as an anti-inflammatory drug and a local anaesthetic by blocking the action of prostaglandins. Fenoprofen has a higher selectivity for the COX-2 enzyme than for the COX-1 enzyme. Fenoprofen may also be a steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that interferes with the action of cortisol and corticosterone on the cell membrane, or a local anaesthetic.

Fenoprofen can be used in a combination with the steroid dexamethasone in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used in the treatment of gout. Fenoprofen has been used for pain relief in migraine and other headache syndromes, and for the relief of other types of pain. Fenoprofen has been used in the treatment of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fenoterol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fenoterol is mediated through its high affinity interaction with the β2-adrenergic receptor.

Mechanism of action

Fenoterol works by activating the β2-adrenergic receptor in the airways. This activation causes the release of adenyl cyclase, which leads to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and thus stimulates the relaxation of smooth muscle in the airways. It also activates phospholipase A2, which stimulates the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which cause further smooth muscle relaxation. The smooth muscle relaxation caused by Fenoterol is mediated through the stimulation of adenyl cyclase, which leads to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and thus stimulates the relaxation of smooth muscle in the airways. It also activates phospholipase A2, which stimulates the production of prostag

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fenspiride is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fenspiride is not known, but it is assumed that it inhibits serotonin receptors in the peripheral tissues, which results in a reduction of serotonin level in the central nervous system, as well as in the periphery.

Clinical trials
Fenspiride has been investigated in clinical trials for its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, as well as for its effectiveness in treating depression and anxiety.

A 2012 review found that there was no evidence for the effectiveness of Fenspiride in the treatment of depression. A 2011 review found that there was some evidence that Fenspiride may be effective in treating schizophrenia, but that the quality of the evidence was not high.

Side effects
Side effects of Fenspiride include dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, headaches, sweating, weight gain, abdominal pain, insomnia, blurred vision, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, impotence, decreased libido, decreased ejaculate, decreased sperm count, and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fexinidazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fexinidazole is not yet known, but it appears to work by selectively reducing levels of free and intracellular fumarate, a toxic metabolite of the nitroimidazole drug, metronidazole. Metronidazole is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and other sexually transmitted infections.

“It has been reported that Fexinidazole may be effective in a wide range of indications,” noted Dr. Joseph G. DeRisi, Ph.D., CEO and Chief Scientific Officer of Insilico Medicine. “We believe that this drug may be particularly effective in combination with other drugs or other types of treatment, including immune system modulators.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of FG-4592 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of FG-4592 is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit the function of Cdc42 and other members of the Rho family of GTPases.

FG-4592 is a potent, highly selective, and orally active inhibitor of Cdc42. In the cell, Cdc42 is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, and inactivated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42. The activity of Cdc42 is regulated by various cellular proteins that either activate or inhibit Cdc42. FG-4592 has been shown to inhibit the function of Cdc42 and to block the activation of its downstream effectors, such as PAK1, which in turn leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, motility, and survival. FG-4592 is currently in phase II clinical trials for the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of fidaxomicin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of fidaxomicin is complex, involving the inhibition of multiple bacterial targets and differentiating effects on bacterial physiology and growth. Fidaxomicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S rRNA and binding to the bacterial ribosome. Fidaxomicin inhibits RNA polymerase by binding to a ribosomal protein L11. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the peptidyl transferase center of the bacterial 23S rRNA. It inhibits bacterial cell division by binding to bacterial ribosomal protein L11. Fidaxomicin interferes with the assembly of the peptidoglycan layer. It inhibits binding of lipoprotein to the bacterial cell membrane. It binds to peptidoglycan precursors and blocks their incorporation into the cell wall.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of filgotinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of filgotinib is the selective inhibition of T-cell activation. The main target of the drug is the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which is a serine protease that inactivates incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Filgotinib also binds to T-cells and reduces T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. The result is inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and induction of regulatory T-cells, which can reduce inflammation and prevent the development of autoimmunity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Finasteride is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Finasteride is as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 5α-reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is the principal androgen in the male reproductive tract and is the primary mediator of the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics. Dihydrotestosterone also stimulates the growth of prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Finasteride decreases serum dihydrotestosterone and prostatic dihydrotestosterone to normal male levels. This inhibition of 5α-reductase by Finasteride leads to a reduction in prostate volume, which has been shown to be the most significant side effect of Finasteride therapy. This inhibition of dihydrotestosterone also decreases the incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer in men with prostates that are greater than 4 cm3 in volume. Finasteride is a useful drug for the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fingolimod is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fingolimod is believed to be due to its ability to act as a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1) antagonist, which results in the sequestration of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and thereby decreases the immune response against self-antigens. Fingolimod also has a very high affinity for S1P3, which causes T-cell sequestration in lymph nodes. S1P3 is expressed on activated T-cells, but is not expressed on resting T-cells.

History

Fingolimod was developed by the pharmaceutical company Novartis, which was later acquired by sanofi-aventis. The drug was first approved by the FDA on May 21, 2010.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fipexide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fipexide is still unknown, but we know that it is able to affect the mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC) in the cell. This inhibition of ETC complexes has been associated with increased intracellular levels of ROS \[[@B18-ijms-20-01109]\]. The data presented in this work support this mechanism of action, since they show a decrease in the intracellular ROS levels after Fipexide treatment. The role of ROS in the antitumor activity of Fipexide has been well studied, and it has been shown that the increase in ROS levels is a necessary event for the induction of apoptosis in many cell types \[[@B18-ijms-20-01109]\].

For example, Flavopiridol has been shown to inhibit CDK2, CDK1, and CDK4 (Kuo, et al., Anticancer Drugs, 1995, 6:1).
Flavopiridol has been shown to have a broad spectrum of activity in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of human tumor cell lines derived from the following tissues: colon, prostate, breast, lung, ovary, cervix, endometrium, and kidney.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Flavoxate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Flavoxate is based on the chemical modification of the nerve impulse conduction in the central nervous system (CNS) by means of its interference with voltage-dependent sodium channels. Sodium channels are a class of integral membrane proteins that form a voltage-gated pore for the passage of ions across the plasma membrane. Each of the 11 known members of the sodium channel family is characterized by a similar structure. They are composed of four homologous domains (DI-DIV) that contain six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a large pore loop (P1-P2). In each domain, four α-helices are arranged in a helix-turn-helix motif (S1-S4) followed by a pore loop (P1-P2).
The primary function of the sodium channel is to generate and propagate an action potential. The activation of the sodium channel in response to an action potential

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Flopropione is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Flopropione is based on its ability to inhibit the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is responsible for the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the citric acid cycle. When succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited, fumarate accumulates. Fumarate inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. When this enzyme is inhibited, pyrimidine biosynthesis is blocked. Pyrimidine is required for the synthesis of DNA. DNA replication requires DNA polymerase, which is blocked when pyrimidine synthesis is blocked.

Because the mechanism of action of Flopropione is based on the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, Flopropione is also known as Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitor (SDI).

The time it takes for the first dose of Flopropione to start working depends on the individual. For some

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Florfenicol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Florfenicol is based on the inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, and also on the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis by binding to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits. These properties are mainly due to the presence of a thiazolyl group in the structure of Florfenicol. The antibiotic is used for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It is also used as a growth promoter in poultry.

The method of analysis of Florfenicol is based on the determination of the drug in the sample. This determination is carried out by liquid chromatography or by gas chromatography. The technique is based on the separation of Florfenicol and the other components of the sample on the basis of their retention times and by means of a detector. The active principle is identified and quantified by comparing the retention time of the drug with that of the reference standard.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Floxuridine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Floxuridine is that it is an analog of thymidine, and has the effect of interfering with DNA replication, ultimately causing cell death. It is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog, and can be taken up by cells by passive diffusion or by the nucleoside transporter. It is phosphorylated by the enzyme thymidine kinase to the monophosphate, which then can be converted to diphosphate or triphosphate by phosphatases. The triphosphate of floxuridine is incorporated into the DNA by the enzyme thymidylate synthase.

In use, Floxuridine is most commonly given orally.  When given intravenously, the half-life is about 15 minutes, and the maximum concentration in the plasma is reached in 2 hours.  Floxuridine is usually given at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, and is often combined with leuc

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Flubendazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Flubendazole is not known. The major mode of action of Flubendazole is by interference with cell membrane functions and it is thought that the interaction with the plasma membrane alters the ion transport system, thus affecting membrane potential and the permeability of cell membranes. It is thought that this results in depolarisation of the membrane and a decrease in the number of Na^+^-dependent pumps in the plasma membrane, resulting in an increase in the cytoplasmic Na^+^ concentration. The increase in cytoplasmic Na^+^ concentration is thought to cause depolarisation of the membrane. Flubendazole also affects the integrity of the cell membrane and it is thought that this disrupts the permeability of the membrane to the uptake of other substances.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Flufenamic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Flufenamic is not clear. One of the postulated mechanisms of action of this drug is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. However, Flufenamic has a poor cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity.\[[@ref11]\] Therefore, the analgesic effect of Flufenamic is not due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase.

Flufenamic acid is an analog of phenylacetic acid and belongs to the fenamic acid class of NSAIDs. The anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects of Flufenamic are attributed to its inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis.\[[@ref12]\] It has been suggested that Flufenamic may act as an antagonist of the excitatory action of glutamate at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.\[[@ref13]

The depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane is thought to lead to loss of intracellular K+ ions, with resultant changes in the metabolic activity of the microorganism.
Flumequine is well absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are attained within one to two hours. Flumequine is metabolized in the liver and is excreted in the urine.

These mechanisms may be the basis of the observed clinical effects of corticosteroids on the reduction of synovitis and arthritis in the acute phase of septic arthritis.^[@R1]^

Corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of septic arthritis, and many studies have demonstrated their efficacy. However, they have been associated with adverse effects.

Response: The mechanism of action of Fluoxetine is not fully understood. Some researchers have suggested that it acts as a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, thereby increasing its concentration in the synaptic cleft, thereby decreasing the signal transmission of serotonin from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron. Other researchers have suggested that Fluoxetine increases the serotonin concentration in the brain by inhibiting serotonin reuptake into presynaptic neuron terminals, thereby decreasing serotonin synthesis and thus the release of serotonin from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron. Still other researchers have suggested that Fluoxetine is a potent agonist of serotonin receptors.

The antidepressant effects of Fluoxetine are mediated by its effect on the central nervous system (CNS), and on the gastrointestinal system. In the CNS, Fluoxetine is an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake into presynaptic neuron terminals, thereby decreasing serotonin synthesis and thus the release of serotonin from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fluralaner is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fluralaner is well known, the dog's body temperature is maintained by a complex thermoregulatory process in which the animal actively regulates its own body temperature. Fluralaner reduces the hypothalamic release of pituitary hormones that regulate body temperature. It does this by blocking the binding of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor in the brain. As a result, the hypothalamus is unable to release the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which in turn leads to a reduction in body temperature. Fluralaner is an alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, resulting in a decrease in body temperature. Fluralaner is an orally active, long-acting, potent, broad-spectrum, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Fluralaner is an effective flea and tick product for dogs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Flutamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Flutamide is to bind to androgen receptors (AR) in the prostate gland. This results in reduced levels of DHT, which in turn inhibits prostate cell growth. In patients with prostate cancer, Flutamide is usually given in combination with castration. However, Flutamide alone can cause testicular atrophy and reduced testosterone levels, with a resulting drop in the PSA. This may be sufficient to cause tumor shrinkage in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

If patients are started on Flutamide at the time of diagnosis, then the chance of being alive 5 years later is 86% compared with 77% if they are started after treatment with hormonal therapy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of fluticasone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of fluticasone is similar to that of other glucocorticoids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone. Fluticasone acts by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in target cells, which results in a decrease in the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, and the subsequent reduction of gene transcription. It also reduces the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6, as well as IL-2 and IL-3, and may therefore have a therapeutic effect in a wide variety of diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease and Addison's disease.
Fluticasone is used to treat a wide variety of diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Formestane is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Formestane is believed to be by inhibition of the aromatase enzyme. The main metabolic pathway for Formestane is the reduction of the aryloxy group, leading to the formation of the diol. In this study, we have examined the metabolism of the diol to the 4-hydroxy derivative, which was found to be formed in the liver microsomes of rats. Metabolism of the diol was not inhibited by the aromatase inhibitor, Formestane, nor by the aromatase inhibitor, Exemestane. In the absence of the diol, the metabolism of Formestane to the aldehyde was minimal. The results suggest that the 4-hydroxy derivative is formed by a metabolic pathway other than that of the aldehyde and diol.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Furfural is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Furfural is not completely understood, however it is known to inhibit acetyl-CoA synthetase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes are essential for the production of acetyl-CoA from acetaldehyde and for the metabolism of alcohols.

As the initial phase of treatment for cancer involves destruction of cancer cells, it is reasonable to expect that the cytotoxicity of Furfural would be initially associated with the induction of apoptosis. The effect of Furfural on cell cycle progression was investigated by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells treated with 10 μM Furfural for 24 hours, showed an increase in the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. However, the increase was only of 7.7% over the control and not significantly different from the control ([Figure 1](#molecules-14-00223-f001){ref-type="fig"}).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Furosemide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Furosemide is not known with certainty, although several theories have been proposed.

One theory of action suggests that furosemide increases the permeability of the renal glomerular capillary walls, thus increasing the rate of glomerular filtration and renal excretion of water and sodium.

Another theory suggests that furosemide causes a water-electrolyte imbalance, causing the water to be retained in the renal tubules.

Still another theory suggests that furosemide causes the distal nephron to concentrate urine, and thus increases the rate of excretion of the solute.

In any event, the diuretic effect of furosemide is effective in treating the symptoms of edema.

Although furosemide is a highly effective diuretic, it does have certain undesirable side effects.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Fursultiamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Fursultiamine is not fully understood. Fursultiamine is thought to inhibit the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which is an important component of the cell growth and differentiation signalling pathways. PI3K is responsible for the conversion of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 then recruits Akt to the membrane and this activates Akt, which in turn phosphorylates and activates a number of other proteins involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis.
A number of inhibitors of PI3K have been developed and some of these have been shown to be effective in a range of cancers. Examples include:

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of G1T38 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of G1T38 is an apoptosis induced by binding to the cell surface membrane receptor. G1T38 binding to its receptor leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB. This results in the transcription of genes, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are involved in the synthesis of an anti-inflammatory protein, TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha). TNF-alpha is responsible for the release of the chemokine, IL-8, from the endothelial cells, and this leads to the infiltration of neutrophils. The release of IL-8 from the endothelial cells is controlled by a mechanism that is independent of NF-kB activation.

G1T38 is an anti-inflammatory compound, which is the result of an ongoing search for new drugs. A recent study reported the anti-inflammatory activity of G1T38 in an animal model of endotoxemia [

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of G-418 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of G-418 is thought to be due to inhibition of ribosomal translation. This is based on the fact that the drug is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in a variety of systems and that it binds tightly to ribosomes. Thus, it has been found that G-418 can be an effective inhibitor of the growth of mammalian cells. The results obtained from in vitro experiments in cell-free systems, and from in vivo experiments in animals have confirmed the effectiveness of G-418 as a cytotoxic agent.
However, the administration of G-418 to patients with cancer has not been found to be an effective treatment for a number of reasons. First, the pharmacokinetics of G-418 is highly variable. The drug has a relatively short half-life and is eliminated quickly from the body, primarily by the kidney. It is also rapidly inactivated by liver metabolism. Thus, the dose required to achieve effective concentrations in the body is much higher than the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gabapentin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gabapentin is believed to be related to the inhibition of α2δ1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels and reduction of the binding of calcium to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.[@ref1] The anti-epileptic effect of gabapentin is based on its ability to reduce the excitability of neurons by decreasing the release of neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate and glycine.[@ref2] This effect is produced by the activation of α2δ1 subunit, which is involved in the modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels and the influx of calcium into the post-synaptic neuron.[@ref3] In the event of excitatory neurotransmitter release, the calcium ion binds to the NMDA receptors and leads to increased release of neurotransmitters. This effect is observed in the brain stem, cerebellum, and thalamus, which are areas with high concentrations of

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gabexate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gabexate is related to the anti-inflammatory activity of the drug and its anti-coagulant activity, since the active form of the drug, gabexate mesylate, inhibits the enzyme COX and thereby reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Gabexate mesylate also inhibits platelet aggregation and the release of granules from platelets.

Gabexate mesylate is a white or almost white crystalline substance with a bitter taste and an astringent taste. The compound is insoluble in water but is soluble in acetone and ethanol. Gabexate mesylate is available in solution form, but is also available in a lyophilized form. Gabexate mesylate is stable for at least 6 months at room temperature and for at least one year when refrigerated. Gabexate mesylate is an acidic substance with a pH of 3.0 to 4.5

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gadoversetamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gadoversetamide is not well understood. Some studies have shown that Gadoversetamide acts by blocking somatostatin receptors, others suggest that Gadoversetamide acts by reducing the somatostatin concentrations in the blood. This may explain why Gadoversetamide is more effective in patients with tumors with low somatostatin receptors and why the drug is less effective in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. The mechanism of action of lanreotide Autogel is well known and was shown to be the inhibition of somatostatin receptors, reduction of somatostatin blood levels, and stimulation of growth hormone release. The mechanism of action of pasireotide is not well known. It has been suggested that it acts by inhibiting the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. It has also been suggested that pasireotide may act by blocking somatostatin receptors. In a recent study,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gallamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gallamine is to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain.

How does it work?

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is important for a variety of functions in the body, including muscles, the nervous system, and the cardiovascular system. In the brain, it plays a role in the regulation of attention and concentration. It also helps to control the movement of muscles and glands.

In Alzheimer’s disease, the levels of acetylcholine in the brain are decreased. The decrease in acetylcholine leads to problems with attention and concentration, as well as other symptoms. The decrease in acetylcholine may be due to the destruction of nerve cells that produce acetylcholine.

The active ingredient in Gallamine is a chemical called galantamine hydrobromide. Galantamine is a natural, plant-derived product

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ganetespib(STA-9090) is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ganetespib(STA-9090) is not completely understood, but it is thought to inhibit the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone and subsequently disrupt protein folding and stability, resulting in a degradation of oncogenic proteins. Ganetespib is thought to act through Hsp90 inhibition, since several proteins known to be degraded in response to Hsp90 inhibition are stabilized when ganetespib is added. Ganetespib inhibits Hsp90, but does not bind to Hsp90 with high affinity. However, the mechanism of action of ganetespib is not completely understood. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), is a potent Hsp90 inhibitor that binds to Hsp90 with high affinity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of GDC-0068 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of GDC-0068 is different from other inhibitors of BRD4 and BET proteins, which all function through a mechanism of competitive inhibition by covalently binding to the bromodomain of BRD4 or BET proteins \[[@CR17], [@CR18]\]. The key difference between GDC-0068 and the other inhibitors of BET proteins is that it does not induce dissociation of BRD4 from acetylated histones, but instead it causes the displacement of BRD4 from the chromatin \[[@CR19]\]. Therefore, it does not disrupt the interaction of BRD4 with acetylated histones, but instead it displaces BRD4 from the chromatin \[[@CR19]\]. These properties make GDC-0068 a more specific inhibitor of BRD4, and this makes it a potential candidate for use in the treatment of different types of cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gemcitabine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gemcitabine is as a nucleoside analog, and is the first drug that has been approved for use in combination with other anticancer agents for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is preferentially phosphorylated in tumor cells, and is incorporated into DNA to form mono- and di-phosphate nucleotide analogs that inhibit DNA synthesis and ultimately result in apoptosis. In normal cells, the phosphorylation of gemcitabine is slower than in tumor cells, and the compound is then metabolized and rapidly eliminated. Gemcitabine has a half-life of 1-3 hours in normal tissues, whereas the half-life of gemcitabine in tumor tissue is significantly longer (approximately 60 hours).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of GHRP-2 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of GHRP-2 is complex. We hypothesize that GHRP-2 modulates hormone secretion and gene expression in beta cells by altering the actions of a number of G protein coupled receptors. These include the putative endogenous GHRH receptor, GHRP-2, and the GHRH/GH secretagogue receptor. The secretagogue receptor is expressed in both beta and alpha cells and has been implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion. GHRP-2 has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells via a mechanism that is G protein dependent and receptor mediated.
GHRP-2 is also known to cause the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland of the subject. In addition, it is known that GHRP-2 will cause growth hormone to be secreted when administered in a variety of species.

Response: The mechanism of action of Glecaprevir is to selectively inhibit the activity of HCV NS3/4A protease and induce the accumulation of non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), which is a key factor in the life cycle of HCV. It is known that the non-structural proteins are involved in the development of resistance to NS3/4A protease inhibitors. However, in the case of Glecaprevir, the frequency of the appearance of resistant viruses is lower than that of other NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The half-life of Glecaprevir is about 12 hours, and it is known that Glecaprevir is metabolized in the liver and is excreted in the urine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Glimepiride is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Glimepiride is as follows: It binds to the beta cell membrane receptor of sulfonylurea, specifically the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). When the binding occurs, Glimepiride inhibits the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP) channel) and opens the ATP-dependent potassium channel (K(ATP) channel), which results in a decrease in the intracellular potassium concentration. This causes the beta cell membrane to depolarize and cause insulin release from the cell.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Glimepiride for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. It is available as a tablet formulation of 1 mg or 2 mg. The recommended dose is 1-4 mg once daily. The initial dose is 1 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks. If the patient does not have adequate glucose control, the dose is increased to 2 mg once daily.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gliquidone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gliquidone is not completely understood. However, the chemical structure of Gliquidone contains the basic elements of an antidiabetic agent, that is, a phenyl group and a carboxylic acid. Gliquidone is a potent, selective, non-toxic inhibitor of glucose uptake in the insulin-sensitive tissues of the body. In particular, it acts to decrease hepatic glucose production and increase peripheral glucose utilization, thereby lowering glucose levels in the blood.
Gliquidone has been shown to inhibit the enzyme, 11.beta.-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of the hormones cortisone and cortisol. Inhibition of this enzyme by Gliquidone prevents the binding of cortisone to receptors in the target tissue.
Gliquidone is an orally active sulfonylurea compound. It has been reported that the compound is about 5-times more potent as an inhibitor of the enzyme 11

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of GLPG1837 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of GLPG1837 is mediated by the degradation of cyclin D1 and inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. CDK4 and CDK6 are components of the cell cycle machinery, which regulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle. During the cell cycle, CDK4 and CDK6 function in conjunction with cyclin D1 to promote the progression of cells through the G1 phase. Aberrant activation of CDK4 and CDK6 is implicated in many types of cancer. In particular, CDK4 and CDK6 have been implicated in breast, prostate, colon, lung, pancreatic, bladder, and ovarian cancers. Accordingly, CDK4 and CDK6 are targets for cancer therapeutics.
The synthesis of GLPG1837 involves the selective modification of the 5-hydroxy group of a 2-deoxystreptamine moiety. In particular, GLPG1837 is synthesized by the introduction of a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gluconolactone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gluconolactone is as follows:

It has been shown to cause a fall in the levels of D-glucose and its subsequent metabolism. This leads to an accumulation of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, which then causes a fall in ATP and ADP levels. This fall in the ATP levels results in an inhibition of glycolysis and glycogenesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Glycolic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Glycolic is quite unique, and may be the reason why this one-step exfoliation is so successful.

At home exfoliation can be done with a flannel and/or microfiber cloth, though some people prefer to use a "grainy" (ie. rough) bristle brush. The key is to scrub gently, yet consistently. The reason for this is that, in order to exfoliate, your skin needs to be pushed slightly beyond its normal state of health. That means removing the outer layer of dead cells. If you're exfoliating too hard, you'll actually remove more of the top layer of your skin. That's why it's important to gently, yet consistently exfoliate your skin.

For exfoliation, Glycolic Peels are great. It's a great, non-irritating, one-step exfoliation. However, they are expensive, and not widely

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Glycyrrhetinic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Glycyrrhetinic is the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several studies have demonstrated that Glycyrrhetinic induces apoptosis in cancer cells through activation of several different signaling pathways. These include the activation of tumor suppressor genes such as p53, p21 and p27, the inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, the inhibition of caspases such as caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-12, the inhibition of DNA repair enzymes such as PARP and the inhibition of telomerase. The combination of Glycyrrhetinic and other chemotherapeutic agents is another strategy for the treatment of cancer. Glycyrrhetinic enhances the activity of other chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting their efflux by ABC transporters, modulating the activity of other proteins involved

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Glycyrrhizic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Glycyrrhizic is still not fully understood. It is possible that Glycyrrhizic exerts its effects by increasing the levels of GLP-1, and this in turn causes the inhibition of gastric emptying. Glycyrrhizic can also affect the cardiovascular system, increasing blood pressure, as well as vasodilation. In addition, Glycyrrhizic can also decrease blood glucose levels, probably through a mechanism involving the release of incretin hormones. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the exact mechanism of action of Glycyrrhizic.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Gramine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Gramine is based on the development of the lipophilic part of the drug by chemical hydrolysis of Gramine molecule. The lipophilic part is more permeable to biological membranes, and the resulting metabolites are more bioavailable and are more active. This is especially important for diseases of the nervous system, where a drug must cross the blood-brain barrier. Gramine is not recommended for use in patients with acute or chronic disorders of the central nervous system.

Gramine is contraindicated in the following situations:

• Patients with hypercholesterolemia.

• Patients with acute or chronic disorders of the central nervous system.

• Patients with conditions that can be aggravated by increasing blood cholesterol.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Griseofulvin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Griseofulvin is still unclear, but there is no doubt that it has a direct effect on the skin (both at the site of application and in the epidermis). A more complex mechanism of action is the antifungal effect. According to the literature, Griseofulvin inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is responsible for the synthesis of ergosterol. The drug can thus reduce the synthesis of the cell wall and, consequently, reduce its permeability.

The effects of Griseofulvin in the treatment of onychomycosis have been well established. Studies have shown that Griseofulvin is effective in the treatment of onychomycosis, although it does not eliminate the fungus. The drug has been used for the treatment of dermatophytosis for more than 50 years.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of GS-9973 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of GS-9973 is thought to be through allosteric binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), thus modulating the efficacy of acetylcholine. Allosteric modulation of the nAChR by GS-9973 is expected to result in a functional effect that is opposite to the functional effect of acetylcholine binding to the nAChR. Specifically, GS-9973 is expected to increase the sensitivity of the nAChR to the effects of acetylcholine.

GS-9973 is a highly selective positive allosteric modulator of the nAChR. The compound binds with high affinity to a novel binding site on the nAChR that has a pharmacological profile distinct from the orthosteric site that binds acetylcholine. The functional effects of GS-9973 are opposite to those of acetylcholine and are mediated by binding of the compound

Response: The mechanism of action of GSK1349572 is not known, however, there are several potential explanations for the differences between the GSK1349572-treated and vehicle-treated groups. GSK1349572 is an irreversible inhibitor of mTORC1, so it is possible that the treatment may have caused non-specific effects on protein synthesis, such as the accumulation of misfolded proteins. It is also possible that GSK1349572 causes a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, which may cause cell death in the drug-treated cells. Further experiments are needed to understand the mechanism of action of GSK1349572.

Our results demonstrate that GSK1349572 is a promising compound for the treatment of CLL. GSK1349572 is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors, including lung cancer and prostate cancer.

During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes promotes the release of E2F transcription factors from the Rb-E2F complex. The E2F transcription factors then activate the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis and S phase progression. Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes are activated by growth factor-mediated signalling through receptor tyrosine kinases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Guanidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Guanidine is unique in the sense that it is highly selective for bacterial and protozoal species, especially gram positive organisms. It does not cross the membrane of red blood cells. It is a pleiotropic agent that interferes with the structure and function of cell walls. It acts by disrupting the crosslinking of the peptidoglycan and the teichoic acid polymers that form the wall of gram positive organisms. The outer membrane of gram negative organisms is composed of lipopolysaccharide, a polysaccharide that is made up of long chains of sugars. The outer membrane of gram negative bacteria is not affected by guanidine hydrochloride.

The drug has been used in a wide variety of infections. It has been used as an adjunct to treatment of staphylococcal infections of the skin, bones, and joints, and also as an adjunct to treatment of bacteremia and meningitis. The drug

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Halazone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Halazone is thought to be similar to that of Chlorhexidine. The anionic (negatively charged) chlorine atoms in Halazone attach to negatively charged groups on the surface of bacteria, which are then unable to maintain an effective negative charge on their surface and cannot repel water from the bacteria. The result is that the bacteria cannot survive.

Halazone is not known to be toxic to human cells, and it does not cause any allergic reactions in the body.

Side effects

The most common side effect of Halazone is a temporary burning sensation of the skin. This can be minimized by rinsing the skin after application.

Halazone has been known to cause contact dermatitis in people with sensitive skin. This is particularly likely to occur when the product is applied to dry, inflamed skin.

Halazone has been known to cause an allergic reaction in some people. In rare cases, people

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Halcinonide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Halcinonide is through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, which results in a reduction in cholesterol content in all lipid-containing cell membranes. Halcinonide also reduces cholesterol synthesis by decreasing the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of cholesterol synthesis. The cholesterol content of all lipid-containing cell membranes is reduced, which in turn causes a decrease in cholesterol synthesis, and an increase in its clearance from the body.

Halcinonide is applied to the scalp topically and to the affected areas of the skin in the form of a shampoo.

History
Halcinonide was first isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces halocynthia in the early 1950s. It was first used clinically as a treatment for seborrheic dermatitis in the early 1960s.

Halcinonide was approved by the FDA in the United States in 1985 for the treatment of

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of HALDOL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of HALDOL is believed to involve the suppression of nociceptive pain transmission by the inhibition of COX-2 enzyme, as well as the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. A mechanism of action for DIC, on the other hand, involves the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors and the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Thus, the combined effect of DIC and HALDOL on the spinal cord is expected to be synergistic. DIC, on the other hand, has an effect on the dorsal root ganglia.

An earlier study has demonstrated that a mixture of DIC and HALDOL (30:70 ratio) is more effective than HALDOL alone in relieving pain in the experimental model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. In the present study, the effects of a mixture of DIC and HALDOL on CCI-induced pain and nociceptive behavior

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of halobetasol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of halobetasol is by blocking the transcription of genes that encode for proteins responsible for inflammation. Its use has been associated with a decrease in skin thickness, reduction in epidermal thickness, and a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells in the skin. It is believed that the reduction in the number of inflammatory cells is due to a decrease in the production of cytokines and chemokines, and that the decrease in epidermal thickness is due to the reduction in epidermal proliferation and differentiation. It is also believed that the decrease in skin thickness is due to the ability of halobetasol to prevent the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the skin.
The safety of topical halobetasol has been studied in numerous clinical trials. The most common adverse effects associated with its use are erythema and burning, which are usually transient and resolve within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment. More severe adverse effects include eczema, pruritus

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Halothane is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Halothane is not well understood. It is known to induce liver enzyme changes, but these are not consistent with those seen with other general anesthetics. It has been postulated that the effects of Halothane are due to a non-specific reduction in the membrane potential and/or an increase in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. However, no studies have been performed to verify these hypotheses. In this study, we measured intracellular calcium concentrations in hepatocytes of mice pretreated with Halothane. We measured intracellular calcium concentrations using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator, Quin-2. Quin-2 is membrane impermeant and is concentrated in the cytoplasm. Quin-2 fluorescence changes in response to calcium ion concentrations in the cytosol. A modified fluorometric technique was used to measure intracellular calcium concentrations. Liver enzymes were measured to monitor the toxic effects of Halothane. Pretreatment of mice with

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of HEDULIN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of HEDULIN is a synergistic interaction between aqueous soluble polymeric form of heparin (Hep) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) (PHS) that produces a synergistic effect in promoting the formation of a stable gel in the extracellular space. The PHS-Hep gel is capable of filling in the pores and spaces in the extracellular matrix of a wound, which in turn, stabilizes the matrix and reduces the likelihood of invasion by foreign bodies, while promoting the migration and proliferation of host cells. HEDULIN may be used alone or in combination with heparin or CS for wound healing.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Histamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Histamine is well known. Histamine can cause smooth muscle contraction by acting on a H1 receptor, a H2 receptor, or both of these receptors. In addition to its contractile effects, histamine also has several effects on vascular and cardiac smooth muscle, on vasodilation, and on secretion of hormones from the adenohypophysis. It has also been shown to act on mast cells, stimulating degranulation and the release of mediators, such as histamine, which cause allergic reactions. Histamine also causes cardiac inotropy (increased force of contraction of cardiac muscle) by increasing the force of contraction of cardiac muscle, and thus it can be used in the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. It has been used in the treatment of hay fever and allergic rhinitis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Hypoxanthine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Hypoxanthine is still unclear. A possible explanation is that it acts as a potent inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enzyme. PDE5 is responsible for the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus cavernosum, a muscle in the penis that relaxes and becomes erect.

In an attempt to investigate the mechanism of action of Hypoxanthine, it was injected into the rat tail vein. The aim was to see if it was capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Rats were then placed in a hypoxic chamber (5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2) for 3 hours. Hypoxanthine was then injected into the tail vein and its concentration in the rat brain measured using a spectrophotometer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ibandronate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ibandronate is not fully understood, but it has been postulated that Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and/or the resorption process. In a recent in vitro study of Ibandronate, the drug was shown to inhibit resorption and to decrease the release of soluble factors from bone marrow macrophages in culture, suggesting that the drug may decrease the production of osteoclasts.
Ibandronate is currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis and is marketed in the United States as the commercial drug, Bonviva® (3 mg and 6 mg tablets).

**Inhibitors of microtubule polymerization**

**Cytotoxic agents**

Microtubules are essential components of the mitotic spindle. During mitosis, the microtubules assemble into the mitotic spindle, a structure that promotes the equal distribution of chromosomes between daughter cells during cell division. If the spindle structure is disrupted, chromosome segregation fails and the cell undergoes apoptosis. Several cytotoxic agents that target the mitotic spindle, such as vincristine and vinblastine, are widely used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors. Paclitaxel, a natural product, is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer. Although these drugs can be effective in killing tumor cells, they also cause severe side effects such as peripheral neuropathy

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ibuprofen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ibuprofen is similar to other NSAIDs. The principal sites of action are the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are the enzyme targets of all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The two COX enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, are both present in most cells. COX-1 is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are involved in maintaining normal physiological functions such as blood clotting, and renal and gastrointestinal functions. COX-2, however, is not present in most normal cells, but is up-regulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, which are involved in the production of prostaglandins and the formation of prostaglandin-induced fever. NSAIDs selectively inhibit the COX-2 enzyme, which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis at sites of inflammation, and are believed to be more effective in reducing

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of IMipraMine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of IMipraMine is based on the sequential inhibition of P2Y12 and β-arrestin-1 by RvD1 and U66, respectively. This dual inhibition may explain the potent antithrombotic activity of the compound, since the P2Y12 inhibition prevents ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and the β-arrestin-1 inhibition blocks platelet activation by high shear forces.

Our data suggest that IMipraMine acts on multiple receptors in platelets, in addition to P2Y12 and GPR17, in order to exert its antithrombotic activity. This is supported by the fact that RvD1 and U66, both compounds of IMipraMine, are agonists of GPR18, GPR32, and GPR32-like 1 (GPR32L1) \[[@B25-ijms-21-00608],[@B26

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of INCB054329 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of INCB054329 is poorly understood, but its potency and efficacy in some solid tumors is a result of its ability to inhibit ABC transporters. In particular, ABCB1/P-gp and ABCG2/BCRP are considered to be the most relevant transporters for INCB054329 ([@B43]; [@B47]; [@B4]). The involvement of ABCB1/P-gp in INCB054329 resistance was first described by [@B3].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of INCB-054329 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of INCB-054329 is thought to be similar to the mechanism of action of thalidomide. Thalidomide was initially developed as a sedative, and has been used as a treatment for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and for multiple myeloma. It was withdrawn from the market in 1996 because of teratogenic and immunosuppressive effects. In a recent phase I study, INCB-054329 was well tolerated and did not cause any serious adverse events in healthy volunteers (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01246746). It has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity of INCB-054329 could be due to the inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, as was observed in an *in vitro* experiment. The anti-inflammatory effects of INCB-054329 were also observed in an animal model of arthritis.

Response: The mechanism of action of INCB057643 is yet to be determined. In vivo data from a phase I trial have shown that this agent can decrease the size of lung lesions in subjects with NSCLC who have received a single prior therapy.[@R21] However, this study was limited by the small number of patients enrolled and the small sample size, and thus further clinical data are required to fully evaluate the activity of this agent in NSCLC.

In summary, INCB057643 is an oral, selective, potent and selective TGFβR1 kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated potent antitumour activity in vitro and in vivo in a range of human tumour cell lines. It has been evaluated in two phase I trials in patients with solid tumours, and both studies have shown that this agent is generally well tolerated, with a favourable toxicity profile.

Response: The mechanism of action of Inulin is currently unclear, but a plausible explanation is that the viscous nature of the dietary fiber increases the viscosity of the intestinal contents, thus reducing transit time and reducing the surface area available for absorption. The evidence supporting this explanation comes from in vitro studies, in which the viscosity of aqueous solutions of inulin was increased and transit time reduced.[@b37-ceg-7-011]

In addition, in vitro studies show that the fermentable fiber increases the amount of short-chain fatty acids in the colonic contents and may decrease the concentration of putrefactive bacteria.[@b38-ceg-7-011] The reduction in putrefactive bacteria is thought to decrease the amount of available substrates for the production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites.

The mechanism of action of resistant starch is also unclear, but is thought to involve the formation of a viscous gel in the small intestine that slows the passage

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of INVEGA is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of INVEGA is different from other approved antipsychotics. INVEGA, aripiprazole lauroxil, is a long-acting injectable antipsychotic approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. INVEGA provides a once-monthly injection of aripiprazole, an antipsychotic that acts on dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems.1

The manufacturer of INVEGA states that aripiprazole lauroxil may provide benefits for patients who have experienced several adverse events or who are not taking their antipsychotic medication consistently.2

INVEGA is approved in the United States and many other countries for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.3

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Iopamidol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Iopamidol is still unclear, but several theories have been proposed. Iopamidol is an amino acid derived, synthetic contrast medium, which is rapidly and freely filtered by the glomerulus and reabsorbed by the proximal tubule. Iopamidol has a short plasma half-life and it is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. This may be the reason why its use in the treatment of acute renal failure is safe. The safety and efficacy of Iopamidol has been demonstrated in several studies. In a recent prospective, double-blind study, 12 patients with mild to moderate acute renal failure were randomized to receive either Iopamidol or saline as a contrast agent for computerized tomography. There were no adverse effects of the contrast medium in any of the patients. This study showed that Iopamidol is a safe contrast medium for use in patients with acute renal failure \[[@b11-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Iopromide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Iopromide is not well understood. Iopromide is an iodinated non-ionic compound, which is believed to exert its effect by blocking the pores of the small blood vessels of the brain. This in turn decreases the influx of fluid into the brain. In order to improve the efficacy of the contrast agent, various physical and chemical methods have been developed. One such method is to reduce the amount of non-ionic compound in the formulation.
Currently, contrast agents that have been approved by the FDA include                (a) ionic compounds such as the ionic iodide based compounds which include the following:                    (1) ionic iodide based compounds including Iopamidol and Iohexol,            (2) ionic non

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of IOSAT is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of IOSAT is based on the innate ability of IOSAT to recognize and remove unwanted macromolecules from the circulation. IOSAT can be used in two different ways: to reduce the size of larger protein molecules or to reduce the size of the protein molecules that form the matrix of larger protein molecules. The use of IOSAT for protein removal is currently used to remove antibodies from patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. The mechanism of action of IOSAT to reduce the size of the protein molecules that form the matrix of larger protein molecules is currently used to remove LDL cholesterol from the circulation.
IOSAT is currently used in the treatment of patients suffering from autoimmunity and other diseases where it is desired to remove or reduce the amount of circulating protein molecules, or other molecules. For example, IOSAT is used in the treatment of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, where it is desired to reduce the size of circulating antibodies or other proteins.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Isepamicin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Isepamicin is similar to other aminoglycosides, namely, by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, causing miscoding of the A-site codon in the mRNA, resulting in premature termination of translation and subsequent cell death \[[@B11-ijms-21-05119],[@B12-ijms-21-05119],[@B13-ijms-21-05119]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Isonicotinic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Isonicotinic is one of the few drugs with a proven mechanism of action. It is a nicotinic receptor agonist, which acts to inhibit neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal.

The drug was developed by the Eli Lilly company, and first made available in the United States in 1997. It is available in a wide range of dosages.

Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, urinary tract infections, nausea, and headache.

More severe side effects may include seizures, liver problems, and low blood pressure.

Mechanism of Action

Isonicotinic is a nicotinic receptor agonist. It works by inhibiting neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal.

By doing so, the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal is reduced. This allows the transmission of nerve impulses to occur more slowly.

It is also a muscarinic receptor antagonist

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Isoprenaline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Isoprenaline is to activate the β~2~-adrenergic receptor on the surface of the cell membrane, which causes the cells to open up, and release certain chemical substances into the surrounding tissue. This is a strong chemical that acts on the body's smooth muscle tissue, causing the muscle cells to relax and widen the blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow into the tissue, and oxygen to reach the cells. This can help to reduce the risk of ischaemia and to stimulate healing of the tissue. It can also cause the heart rate to slow down, which can help to control high blood pressure.

There are a number of other medications that can be used in combination with Isoprenaline. They are used for different purposes and are available in different forms, such as tablets, injections, sprays, and inhalers. For example, if the skin is affected, it may be treated with Calcipotriene, a topical

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Isoproterenol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Isoproterenol is through the beta adrenergic receptors (BARs) and can activate the adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP) second messenger system, and thus result in increased intracellular calcium levels. The effect of calcium on B-cell function can be increased or decreased depending on the level of calcium in the cell. For example, calcium concentrations higher than the concentration of calcium in the cytosol can increase the activity of protein kinase C and thus phosphorylate B-cell receptor proteins, resulting in the increased antigen binding capacity of the cell. Calcium concentrations lower than the concentration of calcium in the cytosol can inhibit the activity of protein kinase C and thus decrease the antigen binding capacity of the cell. Thus, an increase in the intracellular calcium level can be used to improve the antigen binding capacity of the B-cell.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Kanamycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Kanamycin is well established, but little is known about the mode of action of Dibekacin. This study was carried out to establish the mechanism of action of Dibekacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Dibekacin was given orally (1.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 7 days to gilthead sea bream. The fish were killed at 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h after the last dose of Dibekacin. Hepatic tissue was analysed for superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (gamma-GT) activities, and malondialdehyde

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of KD025 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of KD025 is believed to involve the activation of specific apoptotic signaling pathways that leads to the death of tumor cells. Several groups have reported that KD025 treatment of cancer cells induces apoptosis in human cancer cells, and KD025-induced apoptosis is often associated with the activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Apoptosis is an important cell death pathway for the elimination of unwanted cells and is often triggered by the activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases (cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases) (1,2).
Caspases are cysteine proteases that are present in almost all cells and have critical roles in maintaining the integrity of the cell. They are also involved in mediating a number of different types of cell death, including apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and necrosis. To date, 14 distinct caspases have been identified in humans, which can be classified into three subfamilies

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ketanserin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ketanserin is complex. It is a serotonin antagonist, with an affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Its affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor is approximately 30-fold greater than that for the 5-HT1A receptor. Ketanserin also binds to the alpha1 adrenergic receptor and to the dopamine D2 receptor. Ketanserin has a unique property: it blocks 5-HT2 receptors without activating them. Ketanserin has a strong affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 10-9M) and it is not known whether this is the only site of action.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ketoconazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ketoconazole is as an inhibitor of the enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of the intracellular male hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Ketoconazole works by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which is responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. As a result, Ketoconazole lowers levels of DHT, which in turn lowers levels of estrogen.

Ketoconazole has also been shown to block the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). As a result, Ketoconazole lowers the level of testosterone in the blood, as well as lowering the production of estrogen. This results in an overall decrease in libido and an increase in the symptoms of hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms.

If you have had surgery, you may need to take extra time to get rid of any Ketoconazole or other estrogenic medications

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ketotifen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ketotifen is not fully understood. Its mechanism of action has been related to the inhibition of histamine synthesis in the mast cells. In addition to histamine, ketotifen inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, kinins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. The mast cells are also involved in the allergic reaction. The inhibition of the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells leads to a reduction in the hypersensitivity reaction, thus providing an anti-allergic action of Ketotifen.
Ketotifen has been reported to have a broad spectrum of activity. In addition to its anti-allergic and anti-histaminic effects, Ketotifen has also been reported to have anti-anaphylactic activity, to inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis, to inhibit platelet aggregation, and to inhibit the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Kevetrin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Kevetrin is to inhibit the formation of a critical protein complex known as the Hsp90 chaperone, which is a central regulator of multiple cellular signaling pathways, including the survival pathways associated with cancer. In particular, the Hsp90 chaperone is a major regulator of the oncogenic kinase Akt, and Kevetrin binds to the Hsp90 chaperone and inhibits its ability to activate Akt, which results in a rapid and irreversible inhibition of Akt activity in cancer cells. Inhibition of Akt signaling results in tumor cell death and represents a novel mechanism of action for the anti-cancer activity of Kevetrin.
The Hsp90 chaperone is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that is essential for the maturation of multiple proteins involved in cell survival and cell cycle control, including but not limited to, c-Raf, Akt, HER2, B-RAF, c

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lacidipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lacidipine is a potent and long-lasting vasodilator. It selectively binds to the inward-rectifying Ca2+ channels of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which reduces intracellular Ca2+ levels and, as a consequence, vasoconstriction. This results in an increase in blood flow in coronary and peripheral arteries, which is responsible for the hypotensive effect of the drug. Lacidipine has a low affinity for other Ca2+ channels, such as the dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type and N-type Ca2+ channels, which are the target of other Ca2+ channel blockers, such as dihydropyridine derivatives, verapamil and nifedipine. Lacidipine has a different chemical structure from other Ca2+ channel blockers and it does not interact with the outer membrane of the mitochondria.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lapachone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lapachone is based on the formation of covalent bonds between the compound and the nucleophilic sites of the cellular DNA. In the absence of a nucleophilic site, the activated form of Lapachone is unable to react with DNA. In the presence of nucleophilic sites, Lapachone is activated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the naphthalene ring. This hydrolysis is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 system. This process produces the semiquinone form of Lapachone, which is highly reactive and can bind to the DNA molecule. The Lapachone-DNA complex causes a structural change in the DNA molecule that results in the formation of DNA adducts that interfere with DNA transcription, replication and/or DNA repair. The adducts produced by Lapachone can block the transcription of the genes responsible for the cell cycle and apoptosis, and cause genetic damage in the cell.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lasmiditan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lasmiditan is believed to be that of an N-type calcium channel blocker and to a lesser extent, a 5-HT~1~ receptor agonist. However, Lasmiditan also has other pharmacologic actions including anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to its efficacy. This is supported by the fact that patients who experienced headache-related adverse events were more likely to have underlying inflammatory conditions. The risk of headache-related adverse events was also higher in those with a history of migraine with aura. Although the reasons for this association are unclear, we speculate that a subpopulation of patients with a migraine history, especially those with migraine with aura, may have more severe underlying inflammation. However, this is a single post-marketing report and should be interpreted cautiously. It is also possible that other factors, such as other medications that patients were taking, could have been confounding the relationship between headache-related adverse events and underlying inflammatory conditions.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lathyrol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lathyrol is based on the interference of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) with the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), a cytoplasmic protein that regulates a number of cellular processes. The AHR is an intracellular ligand-activated transcription factor that is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The AHR is a member of the bHLH/PAS superfamily of proteins and is activated by its ligands. Lathyrol, a ligand for the AHR, was identified using a screen for AHR antagonists. Lathyrol is a dioxin-like molecule and is an agonist for the AHR. Lathyrol was discovered by Dr. James M. Brown and colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J. It was published in PNAS in May of 2003 and in Science in May of 2003.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lazertinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lazertinib is not fully understood, but it seems to inhibit both MEK and EGFR pathways \[[@B16-ijms-19-01992]\]. The antitumor activity of this drug is similar to other drugs targeting the EGFR pathway \[[@B17-ijms-19-01992]\]. Moreover, the combination of Lazertinib and other drugs such as Erlotinib and Gefitinib has shown an improvement in the PFS \[[@B18-ijms-19-01992]\].

The FDA approved the first selective MEK inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, Trametinib, in 2012. Trametinib is a dual MEK and EGFR inhibitor that blocks MEK activity by inhibiting the MAPK pathway and EGFR by competing with ATP for binding to the ATP binding pocket \[[@B19-ijms

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of L-carnitine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of L-carnitine is still unclear, but several hypotheses have been proposed, which are briefly summarized in [Table 2](#t2-ijms-12-02434){ref-type="table"}.

It has been suggested that L-carnitine plays a crucial role in the transport of long chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondria, thus decreasing the amount of free fatty acids in the cytosol \[[@b61-ijms-12-02434]\]. L-carnitine may also reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species and increase the activity of enzymes involved in antioxidant defense \[[@b62-ijms-12-02434]\]. A recent study also showed that L-carnitine decreases oxidative stress in rats with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[[@b63-ijms-12-02434]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of L-Carnitine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of L-Carnitine is attributed to the ability of carnitine to facilitate the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. When the cells of the body are metabolically active, fatty acids are released from the fat stores in the body. They are converted to energy in the mitochondria by a process called beta-oxidation. Carnitine has been found to enhance the rate of fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria. The result is increased production of ATP, the primary source of energy for all cells of the body.
Carnitine is essential to the function of the mitochondria. When carnitine levels in the blood are low, the ability of the mitochondria to produce energy is reduced. This can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including fatigue, muscle cramps, difficulty in sleeping, a general lack of energy, and reduced ability to think clearly.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LCI699 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LCI699 is based on its ability to inhibit the *de novo* fatty acid synthesis pathway and, thus, block the growth of rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells \[[@CR9]\]. The inhibition of this pathway is a particularly attractive mechanism of action in cancer because cancer cells have a higher demand for fatty acids than normal cells.

In the present study, LCI699 had similar activity to the other CDK4/6 inhibitors in that it induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell proliferation. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of LCI699 is independent of the mutational status of *PIK3CA* or *TP53*. These data suggest that LCI699 is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation and is not reliant on the presence of *PIK3CA* or *TP53* mutations.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LCL161 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LCL161 is complex. LCL161 has been shown to directly inhibit the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by blocking the IκB kinase complex. In addition, LCL161 inhibits the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which promotes NF-κB signaling, and the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, which is downstream of NF-κB signaling. LCL161 also inhibits cell cycle-dependent kinases, including cyclin D1 and cdc2, which are regulated by the CDK inhibitor p21. LCL161 also induces the accumulation of the protein TNF-α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), which inhibits the activity of caspases.

LCL161 is a potent inhibitor of myeloma cell growth *in vitro* and in animal models. A number of phase I/II clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LDE225 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LDE225 is a multi-pronged approach. LDE225 is a highly selective, small molecule agonist of the transcription factor, EGR1. LDE225 binds with high affinity to the ligand-binding domain of EGR1 and activates the receptor. LDE225 also inhibits the binding of the growth inhibitory transcription factor, TGF-β to its receptor, thereby blocking TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. The combination of these two effects leads to increased cell proliferation and reduced cell differentiation. LDE225 has been shown to be effective in reducing the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. The effect of LDE225 on the growth of breast cancer has not been studied.
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for inhibiting the growth of breast cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LDK378 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LDK378 is not yet fully understood. Our data suggest that LDK378 may induce the expression of TNF-α and other cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-25, which are known to be involved in the regulation of immunity and inflammation, as well as in tissue damage.^[@bib24]^ Thus, LDK378 may induce the expression of a variety of cytokines, and these cytokines, in turn, may induce the expression of other cytokines and chemokines, resulting in an amplification loop. The induction of these cytokines and chemokines may be one of the mechanisms by which LDK378 exerts its anti-tumor activity. LDK378 may also affect the growth of tumor cells, as we observed that LDK378 suppressed the proliferation of tumor cells *in vitro*.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Letrozole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Letrozole is based on competitive binding of aromatase enzyme to the androgen receptor, and hence to bind to the hormone-responsive elements of the target gene. Letrozole has also been shown to inhibit the production of other steroid hormones. The estrogen receptor-beta is the receptor for progesterone and 17beta-estradiol, while the estrogen receptor-alpha is responsible for the binding of estradiol and is required for the effects of estrogens on target tissues. Letrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor which is active in vitro and in vivo in a wide variety of cancer cell lines. The human aromatase gene consists of four exons and three introns and the translation initiation site is in exon 1. Aromatase is expressed in several tissues, including breast, ovary, brain, and adipose tissue. The steroidogenic capacity of human adipose tissue is up-regulated by estrogen.

Response: The mechanism of action of Leuprorelin is still unknown, but there are several hypotheses to explain its effects. The action of Leuprorelin is not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. A wide range of other physiologic systems are affected by Leuprorelin, such as the cardiovascular, immune, hematologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The peripheral side effects are usually mild, and the common ones are hot flushes, amenorrhea, and vaginitis. Leuprorelin may also have an effect on the female partner, with an increase in semen volume and sperm count and a decrease in the concentration of antisperm antibodies.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of levobetaxolol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of levobetaxolol is not completely understood. It is believed to be mediated through both direct and indirect effects. The direct effect is believed to be due to binding of levobetaxolol to the β-adrenergic receptors, thereby blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart. The indirect effect is believed to be due to blocking of the effects of adrenaline on the smooth muscle of the blood vessels. Thus, levobetaxolol is thought to be a cardioselective agent.

Levobetaxolol is used to treat glaucoma, an eye disease which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma is a progressive disease which can lead to blindness if left untreated.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Levonorgestrel is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Levonorgestrel is by competitive inhibition of the enzymes, progesterone and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Levonorgestrel inhibits the enzymes by binding to their active sites, and prevents them from binding to the receptors on the cell surface. As a result, the progesterone receptor does not get activated and the hormone cannot be produced.

The use of oral contraceptive pills for women has dramatically reduced the number of cases of uterine and ovarian cancer. However, in the long term, women taking oral contraceptives may be at increased risk of endometrial cancer and possibly of breast cancer. There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptives are linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

The pills are designed to contain different doses of the active ingredient, Levonorgestrel. The different doses may vary from 5 to 30 μg of Levonorgestrel.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LIDEX-E is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LIDEX-E is not well understood and could involve a combination of anti-tumor immune responses and direct cytotoxicity of LIDEX-E to tumor cells. LIDEX-E targets tumor-associated T cells, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenicity. LIDEX-E-induced tumor cell apoptosis is mediated by Fas, which is expressed on tumor cells and activated by Fas ligand (FasL) expressed on LIDEX-E. The Fas-FasL interaction is necessary for LIDEX-E-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. LIDEX-E also interacts with T cells, resulting in T cell activation and expansion. LIDEX-E targets tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in macrophage apoptosis and decreased cytokine production. LIDEX-E also targets natural killer cells, resulting in NK cell activation and tumor cell apoptosis. LIDEX-E

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Linagliptin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of antidiabetic agents that prevent the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and decreases glucose-dependent glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also stimulates the release of β-cells of the pancreas, thereby increasing the amount of insulin produced and helping to normalize the blood glucose levels of diabetics. The action of DPP-4 inhibitors is generally described as increasing the amount of active GLP-1, and as a result, the antidiabetic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is characterized as an incretin effect.
The antidiabetic efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors is associated with increased levels of GLP-1. DPP-4 inhibitors are effective in the treatment of type 2

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lincomycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lincomycin is to block protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome at the peptidyl transferase center of the 30S subunit, thereby blocking elongation of the polypeptide chain. The mode of action of Lincomycin is a hybrid between that of the aminoglycosides and the macrolides. Lincomycin and Amikacin are structural analogs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Linezolid is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Linezolid is unique in the sense that it has two distinct targets: a cell wall component and a ribosomal subunit. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit at a specific region of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), forming a complex that inhibits the peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome \[[@B1]\]. Although the precise target of Linezolid in Gram-positive bacteria is still under investigation, the impact of this compound on the translational machinery is thought to be one of the key mechanisms by which Linezolid exerts its antimicrobial activity \[[@B2]\].

Linezolid has been in clinical use for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and complicated skin and skin structure infections since 2002. Linezolid is also used in the treatment of MRSA infections. However, Linezolid is associated with a number

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Linoleic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Linoleic is an agent that prevents the production of LDL (low density lipoprotein), the very active molecule which is responsible for the build up of fatty deposits in the arteries. Linoleic inhibits the enzyme (HMG CoA reductase) that is responsible for the formation of cholesterol. The body converts Linoleic into cholesterol and uses it for the production of cell membranes and other body functions.

At present, Linoleic is the most popular cholesterol lowering drug. It is one of the three drugs that are in the US FDA’s “top three” for lowering cholesterol. It is also available in the form of capsules and soft gelatine capsules. It is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Liothyronine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Liothyronine is not completely understood. It has been suggested that thyroid hormones exert their action by stimulating peripheral deiodinases, which convert thyroxine (T4) into 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and reversely T3 into T4. Thyroid hormones have also been suggested to act on their receptors in the hypothalamus to stimulate the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH).

Introduction

A review of the literature revealed that no clinical studies had evaluated the effects of Liothyronine on patients with depression. The present case series demonstrates that Liothyronine may be a useful adjunctive agent in the treatment of depressive patients.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LIQUID is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LIQUID is complex. LIQUID uses an enzyme, bovine lactoferrin, which binds iron. This complex of lactoferrin and iron is added to a meal, and the iron is released in the intestinal lumen. LIQUID is not effective for people who have already consumed iron in a meal, or for people who are not lactose intolerant.

Side effects
LIQUID has been studied in humans for a variety of side effects, including iron deficiency anemia. It has been used successfully in infants with iron deficiency anemia, and in children.

LIQUID may cause side effects, including diarrhea, gas, nausea, vomiting, cramping, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

LIQUID has been studied for other side effects. For example, in people with inflammatory bowel disease, LIQUID may increase inflammation in the intestines.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lithocholic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lithocholic is yet to be discovered. But in this regard it is not that much different from bile acids such as Cholic acid. Cholic acid works in the intestine by binding to bile acid receptors, known as G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCR)s. This triggers the production of cAMP, which in turn activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). Activation of PKA results in the phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) and hence, in the inhibition of lipogenesis and the activation of lipolysis. Cholic acid is widely used to treat metabolic syndrome.

Lithocholic Acid and the Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome

Cholic acid has been shown to activate PKA in the intestines. PKA then stimulates AMPK, which in turn leads to the inhibition of fat synthesis and the stimulation of fat burning.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LM-3093 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LM-3093 is to inhibit the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase (PTS), the enzyme responsible for the formation of ammonia from amino acids.

Chemical structure and mechanism of action

LM-3093 is a triazole that has the same mechanism of action as pyrazinamide (an anti-tuberculosis drug).

Efficacy

A recent clinical trial showed that LM-3093 is more effective than the combination of isoniazid and rifampicin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. LM-3093 has shown promising activity in a mouse model of tuberculosis.

Safety

LM-3093 is generally well tolerated in animal models. However, there have been concerns regarding the safety of this drug due to its association with the development of neutropenia and agranulocytosis in patients treated

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LM-3264 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LM-3264 is similar to that of cyclosporin A (CsA), which is a well-known inhibitor of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling pathway. NFAT is a family of transcription factors which are phosphorylated by the calcineurin (CN) signaling pathway. Upon phosphorylation, NFAT is exported from the nucleus and inhibits the transcription of target genes such as IL-2. LM-3264 binds to the CsA binding pocket of CN, thereby inhibiting the CN signaling pathway and thus preventing the dephosphorylation and nuclear export of NFAT \[[@CR32]\]. The difference between LM-3264 and CsA is that LM-3264 is a small molecule and is therefore more easily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract.

It is also a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. It also blocks the PDGF receptor-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. It blocks the Raf-1 kinase and induces apoptosis. It is currently under phase I and II clinical trials in patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia.

LM-3572 is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of PDGF receptor-β, which has been shown to selectively inhibit PDGF receptor-β-dependent cellular proliferation and colony formation in vitro. The compound also blocks the PDGF receptor-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. LM-3572 is currently under phase I clinical trials.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LM-3573 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LM-3573 is based on the ability of LM-3573 to activate the ATP-sensitive potassium (K~ATP~) channel in pancreatic beta cells, leading to the depolarization of the cell membrane and increased insulin secretion. However, LM-3573 does not appear to activate the K~ATP~ channel directly. Rather, it appears to indirectly activate the channel by reducing the activity of the beta cell Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase pump. This is based on the following observations. First, in response to glucose, insulin secretion is inhibited by the K~ATP~ channel activator diazoxide, which also causes beta cell membrane depolarization, but the effect is not as pronounced as with LM-3573. Second, LM-3573 does not cause membrane depolarization in islets isolated from beta cell K~ATP~ channel knockout mice (Geller et al. [@CR17

Response: The mechanism of action of L-NAME is unclear but may be related to inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production \[[@B26]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of Lomefloxacin is similar to that of other fluoroquinolones. It inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Unlike ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, Lomefloxacin is not a substrate for the active efflux pump system encoded by the bacterial chromosome. The increased level of activity against gram-negative bacteria may be due to a reduction in the activity of efflux pump systems.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of lomerizine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of lomerizine is based on the stimulation of voltage-gated K^+^ channels (K~v~), which reduces the influx of Ca^2+^ ions and thus reduces Ca^2+^-dependent intracellular signaling. The resulting reduction of Ca^2+^-dependent phosphorylation of the ion channels causes a dephosphorylation of the channels, resulting in a loss of the conductance of the channels \[[@B29-ijms-21-00304]\]. In the present study, the number of depolarized neurons increased in the retinas of rats treated with lomerizine compared to the control group. This finding indicates that lomerizine is capable of reducing Ca^2+^ influx into the cells. The increase in the number of depolarized neurons in the lomerizine-treated group may be due to a reduction in the number of open K~v~ channels

Response: The mechanism of action of Lonafarnib is unknown. Its target site in the cell is not clear, but the drug inhibits p97 ATPase activity in vitro, suggesting that Lonafarnib may bind to p97, thereby inhibiting its function. Lonafarnib may inhibit the ATPase activity of p97, leading to inactivation of the chaperone complex and prevention of protein aggregation. It may also bind to the chaperone complex, thereby preventing its ability to mediate the unfolding and degradation of misfolded proteins. Lonafarnib is currently being tested in phase I/II clinical trials in the treatment of BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LOTRIMIN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LOTRIMIN is poorly understood. However, we have shown that LOTRIMIN binds to and disrupts the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane, which could lead to loss of membrane integrity and the leakage of intracellular constituents. These constituents are probably delivered into the periplasmic space, where they may cause the misfolding of cytoplasmic proteins. These misfolded proteins are then degraded by proteases in the periplasm, leading to cell death. In summary, the mechanism of action of LOTRIMIN is likely to be related to its ability to bind to the outer membrane and disrupt its integrity.

The best way to understand the mechanism of action of a compound is to determine its mechanism of binding. However, we have shown that LOTRIMIN binds to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and, therefore, it is likely that it will bind to the outer membrane of other Gram-negative bacteria. We

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LOXO-101 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LOXO-101 is likely to involve its inhibition of the interaction between PTPN22 and STAT3. LOXO-101 does not appear to have any activity in cells that lack STAT3 or in cells that lack PTPN22 ([Fig. 2a](#f2){ref-type="fig"}).

We found that the activity of LOXO-101 was dependent on its concentration. A 50-fold increase in LOXO-101 from 10 nM to 100 nM was sufficient to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation in Karpas 299 cells ([Fig. 2b](#f2){ref-type="fig"}). We also observed a similar effect of LOXO-101 in U266 cells ([Fig. 2c](#f2){ref-type="fig"}). However, in contrast to Karpas 299 cells, we found that 100 nM LOX

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LOZOL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LOZOL is complex and involves inhibition of the cell cycle by altering the phosphorylation of Rb, c-Myc and E2F, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. It also exerts inhibitory effects on tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and HER2/neu, as well as downregulating the expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) \[[@B38]\]. It also has antiproliferative effects in vitro and in vivo, and synergizes with doxorubicin and trastuzumab.

In the combination arm, patients received a loading dose of 8 mg/m^2^ of LOZOL followed by 6 mg/m^2^ once a week for 4 weeks, with the addition of 8 mg/m^2^ of LOZOL to weekly trastuzumab.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of L(+)-Rhamnose is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of L(+)-Rhamnose is not yet known, but it is considered a useful treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Rhamnose is an abundant carbohydrate found in nature. The amino acid L-rhamnose, a stereoisomer of D-glucose, has been used as a metabolic precursor for the synthesis of many important carbohydrates. The addition of rhamnose to lactose by a lactose-utilizing microorganism is a convenient means of obtaining lactulose.

This class of compounds is considered to be "dietary fiber", a component of the normal diet that is not digested by the human digestive system. Rhamnose is present in some fruits and vegetables and in some types of fungi, algae, and bacteria. It is used as a food additive to give color and flavor. It is used in the pharmaceutical industry to prepare dextrans and other derivatives.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of L-Threonine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of L-Threonine is the formation of the threonine-dependent enzyme. This enzyme is a phosphate transferase which is activated by a phosphoryl group.

Applications 
The enzyme can be used to produce an amino acid, L-Threonine, by the action of phosphoryl transferase on threonine, which in turn is used to produce antibiotics, amino acids, and other organic compounds.

L-threonine is used as an additive in the food industry to enhance the flavor and texture of baked goods.

Structure 
L-Threonine is an alpha amino acid and is an isomer of L-serine. It is a d-isomer and is produced by the stereospecific deamination of L-serine. L-threonine is a chiral molecule and consists of a chiral carbon and a chiral nitrogen atom. This is why L-threon

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of L-Thyroxine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of L-Thyroxine is not fully understood, but the hormone is thought to act as an agonist of the thyroid receptor, TR beta 1. This receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and it is thought to function as a transcription factor. The hormone is normally secreted by the thyroid gland, and its action is mediated through the thyroid hormone receptor, which is found in many different tissues. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating metabolic processes and development, and they are also involved in a variety of other physiological processes, such as regulation of body temperature, regulation of body weight, and bone growth.
The current market for thyroid hormone replacement therapy is estimated to be about $800 million. However, there is a substantial need for improvement of the therapeutic index of these drugs, in particular, to reduce the occurrence of undesirable side effects.
Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is usually administered in the form of tablets or capsules, and a significant

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LTI-291 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LTI-291 is mediated by inhibition of MDR-1 activity.

LTI-291 has shown activity against a variety of cell lines including resistant cell lines \[[@CR13]\]. This suggests that LTI-291 may have a broad range of activity against tumor types. LTI-291 has been shown to reverse the resistance to docetaxel, vincristine, and etoposide in the resistant human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/AdrVp300 \[[@CR13]\]. The mechanism of this reversal is inhibition of MDR-1 activity, resulting in increased drug accumulation and cytotoxicity \[[@CR13]\]. LTI-291 has also been shown to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the apoptotic agent doxorubicin and the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin and bleomycin in vitro \[[@CR15]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LTX-315 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LTX-315 is related to the blockade of a specific leukotriene receptor subtype (BLT1), which may be used as a novel approach for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

In a previous study, we found that the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTR) LTX-315 inhibited allergen-induced airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma, but had no effect on the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) or airway remodeling.[@b1-jaa-10-163] The aim of the present study was to further investigate the effect of LTX-315 on the allergen-induced airway inflammation and AHR in a mouse model of asthma. We also assessed the potential of LTX-315 to influence the development of airway remodeling in a murine model of asthma.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Lu is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Lu is well understood. It is a competitive antagonist of the M~2~ receptor. In the absence of the ligand, the M~2~ receptor is in an active conformation and binds the endogenous ligand, acetylcholine (ACh), which then acts to modulate postsynaptic receptors. In the presence of Lu, it binds to the M~2~ receptor, displacing ACh and blocking further activation. The end result is that the synapse is desensitized to ACh and the release of other neurotransmitters is reduced \[[@B1]\]. Lu is administered intravenously (i.v.) and is distributed in the blood, allowing its systemic effects to be studied.

The beneficial effects of Lu in AD patients were first demonstrated in a small pilot study that used low-dose i.v. Lu to improve memory and cognition in patients with AD. These data were later confirmed in larger randomized, placebo

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Luliconazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Luliconazole is mediated by inhibition of the Cyp51 enzyme (CYP51), an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of sterols in the fungus. The inhibition of the enzyme results in inhibition of the fungal membrane function, which leads to the killing of the organism. The fungicidal activity of Luliconazole is very rapid. The initial exposure to Luliconazole will kill the organism, with the death of the organism being rapid and with little fungal regrowth.
The chemical name of Luliconazole is (1S,3S,4S,6S)-1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-methyl]-4-propyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-sulfonaphthalene-2-oxide, also known as luliconazole. Luliconazole is the common name for the chemical compound.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LXS-196 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LXS-196 is similar to that of TGN1412. TGN1412 has a highly flexible scaffold structure with two binding sites. LXS-196 has a rigid scaffold structure with only one binding site. The structural rigidity of LXS-196 is advantageous for interaction with the FcγR, and the rigid scaffold structure of LXS-196 is advantageous for interaction with the CD3 complex.
LXS-196 is expected to show superior in vivo efficacy and safety to TGN1412. The safety of TGN1412 was confirmed in a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers (Zhang et al., 2007). The safety and efficacy of TGN1412 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was confirmed in a phase II clinical trial (Feldmann et al., 2007). However, TGN1412 showed severe adverse effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LY2784544 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LY2784544 is not yet fully understood, but there are multiple possibilities. It may inhibit STAT3 directly or indirectly, or it may interfere with the function of the Src-family kinases. For example, a possible mechanism is that LY2784544 could block the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine 705 by Src family kinases, which is required for the dimerization and transcriptional activity of STAT3 [@pone.0114696-Huang1]. Another possibility is that LY2784544 may inhibit the activation of STAT3 by interfering with the dimerization of STAT3, which is mediated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 [@pone.0114696-Sudo1]. In this study, we found that the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was decreased after LY2784544 treatment, and the inhibition of the activation of STAT3 may contribute to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of LY2801653 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of LY2801653 is a combination of reduction in receptor reserve by inhibition of the transcription of P2Y~12~ and a reduction in the binding affinity of ADP for P2Y~12~. Inhibition of P2Y~12~ transcription results in reduction in P2Y~12~ expression and receptor reserve, which will lead to a decrease in ADP-induced platelet activation. The binding of ADP to P2Y~12~ is reduced by the dual inhibition of P2Y~12~ transcription and binding to ADP. The reduction in P2Y~12~ transcription will lead to reduction in P2Y~12~ expression and receptor reserve.

P2Y~12~ is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by ADP. The effect of LY2801653 is to reduce P2Y~12~ transcription. The inhibition of P2Y~12~ transcription

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ACT-064992 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ACT-064992 is the stabilization of HIF-1α by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. HIF-1α is a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of cellular response to hypoxia, a critical feature of solid tumors ([@bib12]). The induction of HIF-1α leads to the activation of transcription of genes involved in tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell survival, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), and erythropoietin ([@bib3]; [@bib11]). The stabilization of HIF-1α is also induced by oncogenic signaling pathways such as the PI3K-AKT pathway, and by prolyl hydroxylases, a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of HIF-1α at proline residues 402 and 564 ([@bib6]).

Response: The mechanism of action of Magnolol is to activate macrophages and modulate their activity. We hypothesized that this would result in a phenotype change in monocytes, as well as an effect on their migration. To test this, we cultured THP-1 monocytes in the presence of magnolol, and measured changes in their phenotype by flow cytometry. We then measured the effect of magnolol on the ability of monocytes to migrate using a modified Boyden chamber assay. We found that magnolol treatment increased the expression of CD80 and CD86 in monocytes, as well as increased the ability of monocytes to migrate. Our results suggest that magnolol can alter the phenotype of monocytes, as well as increase their ability to migrate.

The ability of maltotriose to modulate the channel in these different systems will provide evidence that maltotriose can modulate the channel directly, or that it can exert its effect indirectly via a cellular signaling pathway. Furthermore, we will use a novel screening technique to determine if the composition of the gut microbiome affects the ability of maltotriose to modulate TRPV1.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Manidipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Manidipine is not yet known, however it is known that Manidipine causes a reduction in the intraocular pressure by a reduction of the ocular aqueous humour secretion by acting as an antagonist on the L-type calcium channels located in the ciliary epithelium. The onset of the action is very rapid and lasts 24 hours.

The main side effects are hypotension, bradycardia, headaches, vertigo, palpitations, facial flushing and transient pain in the region of the lumbar spine. The reduction of the peripheral blood flow may lead to peripheral circulatory disturbances (cold and burning extremities, dysesthesias, dysaesthesia and syncopes) which may be transitory.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of m-Cresol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of m-Cresol is a key question in this field. The production of ROS in response to m-Cresol is associated with the release of Ca^2+^ from internal stores and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) \[[@B21-toxins-07-03554],[@B22-toxins-07-03554]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MDV3100 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MDV3100 is thought to be similar to that of Provenge, as both are engineered forms of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that, when administered in combination, stimulate the differentiation of immature CD4+ T cells into mature effector cells. However, there are important differences between the two agents. MDV3100 contains a glycosylated form of GM-CSF, whereas Provenge is a fusion protein that contains a human IgG4 constant region. This allows for the formation of large complexes, which are more stable than small complexes, which may improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the agent. In addition, Provenge is a fusion protein that contains only one cytokine receptor, whereas MDV3100 contains the GM-CSF receptor, which may allow for better activation of the T cells in response to the agent.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mecamylamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mecamylamine is thought to be the inhibition of the acetylcholine-stimulated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor-stimulated ion channel is composed of a pentamer of α-subunits (α2, α3, α4, α5, and α7) and a single β-subunit (β2). The α-subunits contain a ligand-binding site that interacts with agonists and antagonists. The β-subunit, also known as the ancillary subunit, is thought to modulate receptor function by increasing the sensitivity of the receptor to acetylcholine (Wada, S. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 276: 19014-19021, (2001); Colquhoun, A. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275: 43842-43851, (2000); Christopoulos, C. et al. Mol. Pharmacol

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mechlorethamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mechlorethamine is different from the other nitrosoureas, it is a bifunctional alkylating agent that causes the DNA interstrand crosslinking. The chemical reaction involves the methylation of the O^6^-position of guanine by the alkylating agent. The formation of the crosslink causes the DNA to become more rigid and the DNA helix to be unwound, resulting in the inhibition of replication and transcription and the subsequent death of the tumor cell.

Mechlorethamine is a highly toxic alkylating agent and is classified as a carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ([@B1]). It has been used in the treatment of a variety of cancers including Hodgkin\'s lymphoma, testicular cancer, mycosis fungoides, basal cell carcinoma, Kaposi\'s sarcoma, non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Medetomidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Medetomidine is through the selective alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist action on the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe nucleus. Medetomidine acts as a partial agonist at these sites, with the balance between alpha 2 adrenergic receptor activation and inhibition of the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe being modulated by anesthetics that have sedative properties. The resultant activity of the LC and dorsal raphe nucleus in producing sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis, which are the most prominent side effects of Medetomidine, is balanced by the balance between the sedative and arousal effects of Medetomidine on the hypothalamus. Medetomidine has a minimal impact on cortical arousal, although it does enhance the sedative properties of some anesthetics. Medetomidine is a potent alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist and an effective sedative agent with minimal respiratory depression. In general

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MEDROL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MEDROL is the formation of a membrane-bound complex between medroxalol and a specific cytochrome P450 isoform (CYP3A4) that metabolizes it to 6-hydroxymedoxalol. This complex then induces apoptosis by inactivating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and/or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. In this study, the in vitro activity of medroxalol was investigated on human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The anticancer effect of medroxalol was determined by MTT assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay, clonogenic assay, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MEK162 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MEK162 is by inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway. The MEK162-induced apoptosis was found to be associated with the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and the decrease in the level of Bcl-2. MEK162 also induced the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Moreover, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS was significantly upregulated in MEK162-treated cells. The protective effects of TPL on apoptosis were found to be due to the inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAPK activation, and the suppression of the TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS expression. These results demonstrate that MEK162 induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of PC12 cells through activation of the J

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mequinol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mequinol is thought to involve inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP3A4. Inhibition of this enzyme by a range of agents including anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is well established and can result in altered metabolism of other drugs. This may be particularly important when Mequinol is co-administered with other AEDs, or with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. The metabolism of Mequinol is via CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolite 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide. The potential for drug-drug interactions in this case is also relevant as the CYP3A4 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of a number of AEDs. Therefore, the potential exists for alterations in the metabolism of AEDs. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the potential drug-drug interactions

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mercaptopurine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mercaptopurine is through inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis. In the first step, it is converted to 6-thioguanine-nucleotide by enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. In the second step, it is incorporated into DNA and results in chain termination. The therapeutic effect of this drug is due to the high rate of incorporation of this drug into DNA. The side effects of this drug include bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, and nephrotoxicity.\[[@ref1]\]

Toxic side effects can be reduced by the use of low dose of the drug. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of low dose of Mercaptopurine in the treatment of epilepsy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mesna is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mesna is thought to be related to its ability to protect cells from cytotoxic metabolites produced during the action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and to reduce the toxicity of 5-FU to non-target cells. The prodrug is converted to mesylate by hepatic enzymes, and then to the cytotoxic metabolite thiolactone. The latter can diffuse across the cell membrane and react with free thiol groups in intracellular proteins to form cross-linked, DNA-protein adducts that may lead to cell death. Mesna may also be converted to the toxic metabolite uracil, which can inhibit thymidylate synthase.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of metaproterenol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of metaproterenol is unclear. However, it has been suggested that the beta 2-agonist, metaproterenol, may induce lipolysis in humans by stimulating beta 2-receptors in the adipose tissue ([@B1],[@B2]). Lipolysis in adipose tissue is believed to be stimulated by norepinephrine, which is released by sympathetic nerves ([@B3]). Norepinephrine stimulates the beta-adrenergic receptors in adipose tissue to activate the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP ([@B3]). This, in turn, stimulates the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cyclic AMP to AMP. AMP is then metabolized to adenosine and inorganic phosphate by the enzyme adenosine deaminase. The accumulation of adenosine in the tissue, and thus the local production of adenosine by adenos

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of metaraminol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of metaraminol is thought to be via the peripheral adrenergic receptors of the postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The degree of blood pressure reduction is proportional to the dose of the drug and the duration of treatment. Metaraminol has a rapid onset of action, and in doses of 0.5-1.0 mg given intravenously or intramuscularly produces a rapid fall in blood pressure (15-30 minutes) and a fall in heart rate of 10-20 beats per minute. The hypotensive effect is not accompanied by reflex tachycardia or symptoms of central nervous system stimulation. The hypotensive action of metaraminol is generally reversed by 6-12 hours after administration.

Methenamine is a non-absorbed, non-ionised compound which is widely used as a urinary acidifier. Methenamine is a readily available compound. However, the pH of the stomach can cause problems in the administration of Methenamine. The pH of the stomach is normally 1-2 and is an alkaline environment. The pH of the stomach is a major barrier to the passage of compounds into the small intestine. The use of Methenamine to treat enteric infections has therefore been limited.

Advantages of Methoxamine

Ease of Use

Methoxamine is a tablet which is taken orally. It is usually prescribed to people with heart conditions.

There is a significant difference between the effects of Methoxamine and that of other vasodilators.

Methoxamine does not work in the same way as other vasodilators. This is because Methoxamine is a non-specific vasodilator. This means that it relaxes all the smooth muscles of the body, including blood vessels, the bronchi, and the urethra.

It is this ability to relax smooth muscles that makes Methoxamine so useful in the treatment of heart conditions.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Methoxsalen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Methoxsalen is not fully understood. It is thought that it is absorbed and reaches the melanin-containing cells of the epidermis, where it produces a photo-oxidation of the melanin and causes damage to the cell membrane. The formation of free radicals by the photo-oxidation of the melanin may result in the breakdown of the membrane, leading to the release of the cell contents and the generation of an inflammatory response.\[[@ref9]\] This is the main reason for the effectiveness of Methoxsalen in treating a variety of skin disorders such as psoriasis and vitiligo.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Methylene is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Methylene is unclear but its effect on gene transcription has been demonstrated in both yeast and human cells. The influence of methylene on gene expression is through the interaction with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (RNAPIIo). RNAPIIo is composed of 12 subunits: Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb4, Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb7, Rpb8, Rpb9, Rpb10, Rpb11 and Rpb12. Each subunit contains an intrinsic DNA binding domain and a region that interacts with the carboxy terminal domain of the core enzyme. Methylene binds to the region that interacts with the carboxy terminal domain of the core enzyme and inhibits the interaction between the subunits of the RNAPIIo complex. This interaction leads to a conformational change of the core enzyme which leads to the inability of the enzyme to recognize and bind to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of METOLAZONE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of METOLAZONE is as follows:

METOLAZONE blocks a key enzyme, called glycogen phosphorylase, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen, the main storage form of sugar in the body. This in turn reduces the amount of glycogen available to the body, which in turn means that the liver cannot make any more glycogen, and so there is less sugar in the blood.

METOLAZONE is used in the treatment of:

Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in people with Type 1 diabetes who are not making enough insulin, or in people with Type 2 diabetes who have had their insulin dose reduced because of difficulties in maintaining good blood sugar control.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mexiletine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mexiletine is not completely understood. In a study on dog Purkinje fibers, a single dose of Mexiletine at 1.25 mg/kg resulted in a significant prolongation of action potential duration (APD), in a concentration-dependent manner, in both the extracellular (0.25-4.0 mg/L) and intracellular (0.1-2.0 mg/L) spaces. Mexiletine prolonged the time to peak of the transmembrane action potentials and increased the Vmax, but did not alter the slope of the activation phase. In addition, Mexiletine increased the Vmax and decreased the slope of the inactivation phase of the action potential. The findings suggest that Mexiletine is a class I antiarrhythmic agent with a primarily voltage-dependent, non-use dependent, and open-channel blocking mechanism of action.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MGL-3196 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MGL-3196 is different from that of MTX. It may be more advantageous to use the combination of MGL-3196 and MTX for the treatment of RA. In addition, in the subgroup analysis of DMARDs, there were differences in the anti-TNF agents and IL-6R inhibitors. It is possible that these differences might be due to the characteristics of the drugs used in the subgroup analysis. The patient background in each group is also different. In particular, patients with RA who are taking anti-TNF agents or IL-6R inhibitors are known to be resistant to MTX. Thus, the patients with RA who are resistant to MTX or anti-TNF agents may be more likely to respond to the combination of MGL-3196 and MTX.

It has been reported that the mechanism of action of MGL-3196 is based on its binding to GPR35 \[[@B

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mianserin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mianserin is believed to be through its interaction with 5-HT2A receptors on presynaptic neurons, thus increasing their release of 5-HT, which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. This is why mianserin is prescribed for conditions such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.

Common side effects include sedation, nausea, and drowsiness.

Response: The mechanism of action of MICARDISis different from other available therapies for EOC. It is also possible that MICARDISis acts by targeting different pathways than do the other available therapies. In contrast to other therapies, MICARDISis does not require a toxic dose of chemotherapy and has a lower risk of inducing adverse side effects.

To our knowledge, MICARDISis has been the only therapeutic agent that has shown promising results in a phase II clinical trial for EOC. Because MICARDISis has the potential to be used in combination with standard therapy, it is an attractive candidate for further study.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MIFEPREX is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MIFEPREX is believed to involve inhibition of specific adhesion molecules on endothelial cells which are involved in leukocyte adhesion. These adhesion molecules include the selectins, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. MIFEPREX is believed to function by inhibiting the interaction between these molecules and specific adhesion proteins expressed on the surface of leukocytes.
MIFEPREX is indicated for the treatment of patients with active RA who have not responded to at least two anti-TNF agents, such as infliximab, and are candidates for methotrexate therapy.
The efficacy of MIFEPREX has been demonstrated in patients with moderate to severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to two anti-TNF agents. In the MIFEPREX clinical trial, 68.3% of patients receiving MIFEPREX were in remission at week 24.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Miglitol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Miglitol is unknown. Miglitol does not cause insulin to be released from the pancreas and it does not cause any other adverse effects that are seen with sulfonylureas. The only side effects associated with Miglitol use are related to carbohydrate metabolism. There are three possible mechanisms of action for the drug. First, it may inhibit intestinal alpha-glucosidases and/or delay gastric emptying, which would reduce the rate of carbohydrate absorption. Second, it may block the rapid metabolism of carbohydrates, or third, it may cause an increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis.

Patients who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should receive an oral agent as the first step in diabetes treatment. In general, sulfonylureas are the first choice for monotherapy. However, because of their side effects, such as hypoglycemia, they are used only in combination with insulin. Miglitol is an alternative

Response: The mechanism of action of Mildronate is as follows:
1) Mildronate causes irreversible, covalent binding of the active moiety, a derivative of folic acid, to protein sulfhydryl groups, resulting in the formation of stable complexes.
2) Mildronate is preferentially taken up by the dividing cells of the body.
3) Mildronate competes with folic acid for binding to the same protein sulfhydryl groups that are inactivated by the Mildronate derivative of folic acid.
4) As the concentration of the Mildronate derivative of folic acid increases, more protein sulfhydryl groups become inactivated.
5) The presence of inactivated protein sulfhydryl groups blocks the DNA replication and cell division process.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Milnacipran is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Milnacipran is not fully understood, but its antidepressant-like effects have been attributed to its inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake in the brain and the spinal cord (Kroener and Langer, [@B15]). The noradrenergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression, and noradrenergic dysfunction has been found in depressed patients (Riemann et al., [@B27]). Noradrenaline plays a major role in the pathophysiology of depression and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the brain is involved in the regulation of a variety of behavioral and physiological functions, such as attention, arousal, and motivation (Healy and McEwen, [@B12]).

Several lines of evidence suggest that serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic systems are all involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In particular, serotonin (5-HT

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MINTEZOL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MINTEZOL is based on the inhibition of the first step of the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the mevalonate pathway, which is catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) ([@b14-mmr-15-06-3525]). HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway and its expression is controlled by transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and liver X receptor (LXR). The transcription of the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase is controlled by SREBP and LXR, which, when activated, regulate the expression of genes encoding key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including HMG-CoA reductase ([@b15-mmr-15-06-3525]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mirogabalin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mirogabalin is to block the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.3 and thereby reduce hyperexcitability. Mirogabalin has a higher selectivity for Nav1.3 channels than other sodium channel subtypes. The selectivity of Mirogabalin is further increased when it is bound to plasma proteins (protein-bound concentration) as compared to the unbound concentration (unbound concentration).

Unbound Mirogabalin is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and the primary metabolites are M1 and M8. Mirogabalin is also a substrate of CYP3A4 and M8 is the primary metabolite of Mirogabalin that is formed by the CYP3A4 enzyme. M1 is formed by the reduction of the amide group and is subsequently conjugated to glucuronic acid or sulphate. M8 is formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MIRTAZAPINE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MIRTAZAPINE is not well understood. It is an atypical antipsychotic, with potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, but low antagonism at other monoamine receptors. It also binds with high affinity to the α1-adrenergic receptor and the histamine H1 receptor, although its affinity for these receptors is approximately half that of clozapine. MIRTAZAPINE has a low affinity for dopamine and serotonin receptors.

Metabolism
MIRTAZAPINE is extensively metabolized in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the small intestine, and via a variety of oxidative pathways. The main metabolic pathway is hydroxylation of the piperazine ring, which results in the formation of the active metabolite N-desmethylmirtazapine. A minor metabolic pathway involves N-dealkylation, resulting in the formation of 3-piperazinyl-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Misoprostol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Misoprostol is not fully understood. It may cause the release of prostaglandins and/or prostaglandin-like compounds. It may also cause increased absorption of mucus and bicarbonate secretion from the gastric mucosa. It may cause relaxation of the smooth muscle in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it may cause the release of endogenous prostaglandins. It is believed that this action of Misoprostol is mainly responsible for its antisecretory and antipyretic actions.

In addition to its antisecretory action, Misoprostol may also have some effects on the nervous system. For example, it has been suggested that it may cause relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and thus decrease the risk of reflux.

It is believed that Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog. The dose of the drug varies

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MK4827 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MK4827 is to prevent an active enzyme, glucokinase, from activating the insulin signaling pathway. This is achieved by inhibiting the formation of the active form of glucokinase, which normally occurs through a reaction catalyzed by glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). GKRP is the protein which facilitates the conversion of inactive, glucokinase to active, glucokinase by stabilizing the active form of glucokinase. By preventing the formation of active glucokinase, MK4827 is thought to prevent the activation of the insulin signaling pathway. MK4827 is a highly specific inhibitor of glucokinase and does not inhibit other proteins which are structurally related to glucokinase.
In the U.S. and in Europe, there are currently no marketed drugs that specifically target the glucokinase pathway for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Thus, there is a need for a safe, effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.

In the present study, the effects of MLN2480 on the migration and invasion of HCC cells were examined. The results demonstrated that MLN2480 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MLN2480 has potential as a therapeutic agent for HCC.

The results of the present study also demonstrated that MLN2480 significantly inhibited the expression of BRD4 in a dose-dependent manner in

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MLR-1023 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MLR-1023 is complex and the target of MLR-1023 is not well defined. We believe that MLR-1023 acts by stabilizing a protein complex of hFPR1 with one or more proteins and thereby alters the activation of the cell.

We have identified a previously unknown ligand for FPR1 that is a peptide derived from bacterial proteins. It is of interest that FPR1 is found in humans, mice and *Drosophila* and is also found in other organisms that have been shown to have a type 1 immune response [@pone.0053706-Lee1], [@pone.0053706-Uematsu1], [@pone.0053706-Takeshita1]. This suggests that FPR1 is a receptor for an evolutionarily conserved immune response in which peptides derived from bacterial proteins are recognized by a receptor and initiate an immune response.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Moclobemide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Moclobemide is as a reversible, non-selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is metabolised in the liver to form M1, a potent inhibitor of MAO-A and a less potent inhibitor of MAO-B. The M1 metabolite is further metabolised in the liver to M2, a potent inhibitor of MAO-A and a less potent inhibitor of MAO-B. The M2 metabolite is inactivated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to form M3, which is a more potent inhibitor of MAO-A than M2. M3 is also a substrate for CYP2D6, which further metabolises M3 to form M4, which is a potent inhibitor of MAO-A and a less potent inhibitor of MAO-B. M4 is inactivated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to form M5, which is a potent

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Moxonidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Moxonidine is not completely understood. It is thought to act through imidazoline receptors, with an imidazoline-binding site and an alpha2-adrenoceptor blocking site. Moxonidine does not have any adrenergic activity. It is thought to produce its effects through inhibition of central alpha2-adrenoceptors. The result is a decrease in sympathetic tone, which in turn leads to a decrease in blood pressure.

Moxonidine is thought to be as effective as the other alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists, but with a much better side effect profile.

The recommended starting dose is 0.1mg daily. The dose is increased gradually by 0.1mg per week until the desired effect is achieved. It is recommended that patients are maintained on the lowest effective dose for at least 2 months before a decision is made to reduce the dose or to stop the medication. It is important to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mozavaptan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mozavaptan is not completely understood, however it is thought to be a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. It is currently not known whether this drug is safe and effective in children.

Drug Description

Mozavaptan is a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.

Indications

Mozavaptan is indicated for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in adults.

How It Works

Mozavaptan is used to treat patients with hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This condition is caused by a malfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is responsible for maintaining the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MSX-122 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MSX-122 is based on the modulation of key oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin and Notch, and its inhibition of the STAT3 and JAK/STAT pathways.

In a previous study, MSX-122 showed potent antiproliferative effects on human myeloma cell lines and patient-derived primary cells \[[@B39-cancers-12-02108]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MUCINEX is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MUCINEX is similar to that of MUCINET (Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}). However, it differs in that it is administered as a two-step process and is an injectable drug. The first step is to remove the MUC1-derived mucin MUC1-M from the blood. This is done by the administration of MUC1-M binding antibodies (MAB1-40 and MAB1-32). After the binding antibodies bind to MUC1-M, they cross-link with other MUC1-M molecules, which are found on the surface of the cancer cells. This cross-linking of the MUC1-M molecules results in a decrease in their affinity for the blood proteins, which leads to the binding of MUC1-M to Fc receptors on macrophages and natural killer cells, which results in the elimination of MUC

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mupirocin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mupirocin is due to the inactivation of bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), an essential enzyme in bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis. Mupirocin is used for the topical treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.

Mechanism of action

Mupirocin is an antibiotic derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens, an actinomycete which inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by inhibiting isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). This is a specific enzyme that is essential for the cell-wall biosynthesis in bacteria. Mupirocin does not kill the bacteria by targeting DNA replication, protein synthesis, or membrane integrity, and it does not interfere with the cell wall assembly machinery.  In the late 1960s, researchers discovered that mupirocin and other β-lactams inactivate the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Mycophenolic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Mycophenolic is to stop the production of the white blood cells called T-cells. These T-cells are the body's immune system fighters and they play a vital role in fighting off infections. This is done by attacking and destroying the cells that contain the virus, bacteria or other infections.

T-cells are made in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. These two organs are where T-cells are made. Mycophenolic will stop the production of T-cells in the bone marrow and the lymph nodes.

T-cells also circulate through the bloodstream and this is where Mycophenolic is given. The drug travels through the bloodstream and into the bone marrow and lymph nodes where the T-cells are made.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of MYSOLINE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of MYSOLINE is not fully understood. The key difference between the effects of topical MYSOLINE and the orally administered form of an NSAID is that MYSOLINE can reduce or eliminate inflammation that is caused by a tissue injury. MYSOLINE can also reduce or eliminate inflammation that is caused by bacterial infection. The inflammation-reducing effect of MYSOLINE is caused by the combined effect of the anti-inflammatory activity of the drug and the production of additional enzymes that the body produces in response to the topical application of MYSOLINE. These enzymes reduce the swelling, pain, and redness that are caused by the tissue injury or bacterial infection. The enzyme that plays the most important role in this action is an enzyme that breaks down the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). The extra-cellular matrix is the substance that is found in the skin, in the membranes, and in the tissues of the body. This matrix is the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of N-Acetylglucosamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of N-Acetylglucosamine is as follows:
N-Acetylglucosamine is a natural component of the bacterial cell wall, and it has been reported that N-Acetylglucosamine plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the bacterial cell wall. N-Acetylglucosamine binds to the lipid A region of the bacterial cell membrane, and thus disturbs the function of the lipid A. As a result, it is reported that the antimicrobial activity of the bacteria is enhanced, and the permeability of the cell membrane is increased.
However, it has been reported that N-Acetylglucosamine is highly toxic to animals. N-Acetylglucosamine can be broken down in the body, and can cause the synthesis of a substance that is toxic to the body.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of NADIDE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of NADIDE is to increase bioavailability of vitamin C. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that is not synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. Low levels of vitamin C have been implicated in many disease processes including cancer. It is thought that the bioavailability of vitamin C may be limited by two mechanisms:

1.  Decreased absorption of vitamin C due to decreased levels of vitamin C-binding protein in the blood.

2.  Decreased utilization of vitamin C due to increased utilization of vitamin C by cancer cells.

It is thought that NADIDE increases the absorption of vitamin C by increasing the levels of vitamin C-binding protein. The results of a recent study show that NADIDE increases the levels of vitamin C-binding protein in the blood, and as a result increases the absorption of vitamin C \[[@B1]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of Nafamostat is not fully understood. However, it is known to inhibit several enzymes including coagulation factors Xa, IIa, IIb, and kallikrein. These enzymes are responsible for the production of thrombin, the primary coagulation protease. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and activation of fibrinogen to fibrin. It is thought that Nafamostat blocks the catalytic site of the enzyme and inhibits its ability to convert prothrombin to thrombin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nafarelin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nafarelin is believed to be mediated through a decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. The decrease in SHBG levels is believed to cause an increase in free estradiol and free testosterone, which in turn is thought to increase ovarian and testicular follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and therefore to increase follicle growth.
Nafarelin may be administered alone or in combination with other growth-promoting hormones, including FSH and/or LH. The dosage of Nafarelin for growth hormone therapy will vary depending on the specific individual, but the dosage is expected to be between 0.1-5.0 mg/day, more preferably between 0.5-2.0 mg/day, and most preferably between 0.5-1.0 mg/day.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nalidixic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nalidixic is believed to be based on a selective interaction with certain bacterial DNA gyrase molecules. In vitro studies have shown that Nalidixic has minimal activity against eukaryotic DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. Nalidixic is a pyridinolone antibiotic that is structurally similar to other well-known quinolones. In general, quinolones inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The quinolones also appear to act on a number of other targets in the cell.
Quinolone antibiotics inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Gyrase is a topoisomerase enzyme that controls topological states of DNA during replication, transcription, and repair (Champoux, J. J. (1995) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 64, 369-413). Gyrase is the first step in DNA

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Naloxone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Naloxone is not well understood. It is a well-known antagonist of the opioid receptors and has been used to treat opioid overdose, but there is no consensus on how or when to use Naloxone. While it has been shown to reverse the effects of heroin, morphine, codeine, and oxycodone, there is no data showing it is effective for other opioids. In addition, there is no data showing that Naloxone can reverse the effects of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. This case report demonstrates that the use of Naloxone may be an effective therapy for reversing the effect of warfarin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Naltrexone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Naltrexone is through its interaction with the opiate receptor. The use of Naltrexone to help maintain the sobriety of alcoholics and drug addicts was first used in the late 1950's. Naltrexone is usually administered orally, but it may also be administered intravenously.

Advantages

One of the most significant advantages of Naltrexone is that it works well as a maintenance drug, i.e. it helps to keep people on their medication. The usual treatment of alcoholism is to start the patient on Naltrexone and then gradually taper off the dosage. The use of Naltrexone has a number of advantages, not the least of which is that the patient can stop drinking without the danger of a relapse. Naltrexone has a long history of safety and efficacy, and it is widely used as a treatment for opioid addiction.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Naringin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Naringin is currently unknown. However, it is assumed that it is an antioxidant that scavenges free radicals \[[@CR31]\]. This antioxidant activity is one of the mechanisms by which Naringin is able to exert a number of beneficial effects, including the control of insulin resistance \[[@CR32]\].

We have previously shown that the antioxidant activity of Naringin is responsible for its anti-inflammatory effect \[[@CR33]\]. However, in this study, we observed that Naringin was able to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, as well as to prevent macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, suggesting that its anti-inflammatory activity may also be involved in its ability to improve the insulin sensitivity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of NATACYN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of NATACYN is to produce a locally irritating reaction in the tissues which are infected. The skin lesions which occur in humans are similar to those which occur in animals. The irritating action of the compound is usually manifested by the appearance of a reddish papular skin reaction which is usually well-defined, not spreading, and which is not pruritic. The inflammatory response can be controlled by application of a non-irritating amount of NATACYN and is often followed by healing without scarring.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of nateglinide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of nateglinide is believed to be similar to that of sulfonylureas. Nateglinide stimulates insulin release by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor on the pancreatic β-cell, which results in the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, membrane depolarization, and calcium influx. In response to the calcium influx, insulin is released. Because nateglinide is a direct ATP-sensitive potassium channel activator, the effect of nateglinide on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is rapid and results in a smaller increase in plasma glucose than with sulfonylureas. This is due to the relatively short half-life of nateglinide. The short half-life is due to a relatively rapid metabolism of nateglinide by esterases.
Nateglinide has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Since insulin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of netilmicin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of netilmicin is not yet fully understood. It has been reported that netilmicin induces apoptosis in cancer cells and is not cytotoxic for normal cells. This suggests that netilmicin can be an important new class of antimicrobial agent for treating certain cancers \[[@B2]\].

This study was carried out to determine the cytotoxic activity of netilmicin on rat and human prostate cancer cells, PC-3 and DU145, respectively, and compare it with the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and docetaxel. The results of this study showed that netilmicin was cytotoxic for both cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU145. Netilmicin had a higher cytotoxic effect on the PC-3 cell line, compared to the DU145 cell line. This suggests that netilmicin may be more effective in treating prostate cancer than other types of cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nicaraven is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nicaraven is not fully understood. However, Nicaraven acts as an antagonist of calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) in the cardiovascular system and thereby produces vasodilation by causing a reduction in intracellular calcium concentration and an increase in the cytoplasmic potassium concentration.

In animal models of sepsis, Nicaraven has been shown to decrease the inflammatory response, and the mortality of animals with sepsis, and to attenuate the effects of endotoxin. In human trials, Nicaraven has been shown to increase urine output and reduce the levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood of patients with acute renal failure.

As a combination drug, Nicaraven is indicated for the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF) and in combination with haemofiltration for the treatment of acute renal failure in patients with sepsis and septic shock.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Niclosamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Niclosamide is not fully understood but is thought to inhibit the Na^+^/H^+^ exchanger, thereby preventing the extrusion of protons (H^+^) across the cell membrane.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Niflumic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Niflumic is that it works by blocking the cationic channel (TRPM8) which is involved in the sensory transduction of cold. By blocking this channel, the cold receptors will no longer be stimulated, which will reduce the sensation of cold.

Niflumic is used to treat conditions like hypothermia, but may also be used to treat other conditions like painful menstruation, headache, menstrual cramps, sinusitis, sore throat, and allergies. It may also be used to prevent migraine.

Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the condition being treated. Some doses will be given as a single dose. Others may be given as a once-daily dose. For some conditions, the treatment may be continued for weeks or months.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nifurtimox is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nifurtimox is not well understood. The drug exerts its toxic effects by activating the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme system, especially in the liver. The cytotoxicity of Nifurtimox has been demonstrated in vitro in a variety of cell lines. In vivo, a wide range of doses have been used. Some authors report cytotoxicity at very low doses of Nifurtimox (10 to 100 mg/kg/day) [9, 10]. Other authors report that Nifurtimox was not cytotoxic at doses of up to 5 g/kg/day [11]. However, in vivo studies using the LD50 are very rare and the studies that have been conducted are often contradictory. Most studies used Nifurtimox at doses between 30 and 300 mg/kg/day.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nisoldipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nisoldipine is not completely understood, however, the drug is known to block the calcium channels in the plasma membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells. The calcium channel is a complex multimeric protein with at least two types of subunits (L-type and N-type) which are found in the plasma membrane. These channels regulate the influx of calcium ions into the cells which is a necessary step in the signal transduction mechanism that leads to smooth muscle contraction. Thus, the ability of Nisoldipine to relax smooth muscle has led to the development of Nisoldipine for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris.
Nisoldipine is currently marketed in a variety of dosage forms including tablets, capsules, granules, and liquid preparations. However, despite the known efficacy of Nisoldipine in treating hypertension and angina pectoris, there are currently no convenient oral dosage forms that can provide for immediate and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nitrendipine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nitrendipine is believed to be primarily based on calcium antagonism. In contrast to dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, however, the enantiomers of Nitrendipine have different pharmacokinetic profiles and potencies. The enantiomers of Nitrendipine show similar affinities for the vascular smooth muscle L-type calcium channel, but the (-) enantiomer is much more potent than the (+) enantiomer as an antihypertensive agent in vivo. This property is believed to be related to the pharmacokinetic profile of the enantiomers, which has been found to be enantioselective, being faster for the (-) enantiomer.
Enantioselective pharmacokinetics of Nitrendipine has been demonstrated in animal models, and in clinical studies. In clinical studies, administration of the (-) enantiomer of Nitrendipine resulted in a more rapid onset of action and greater reduction

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nizatidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nizatidine is by blocking the histamine-2 (H2) receptors in the parietal cells of the stomach. Nizatidine is also a H2 antagonist that can cause the release of serotonin and causes the stimulation of cholinergic receptors. Nizatidine inhibits gastric acid secretion, as a result of its H2 antagonist activity, and stimulates gastric emptying and inhibits the release of pepsin and pepsinogen. Nizatidine also reduces gastric acidity by increasing the release of bicarbonate ions from the parietal cells of the stomach. It is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, and therefore can also inhibit the secretion of gastrin from the G cells of the pancreas, and increase the release of somatostatin from the D cells of the pancreas.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of NMS-P937 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of NMS-P937 is through a unique combination of multiple mechanisms of action. This drug binds to the Aurora B kinase with a very high affinity and exhibits a potent inhibitory activity on Aurora B kinase activity in vitro and in cells. NMS-P937 has been shown to have a unique effect on Aurora B kinase activity, which is to cause hyperphosphorylation of the N-terminal regulatory region of the Aurora B kinase. This results in inhibition of the interaction between the Aurora B kinase and its regulatory subunit INCENP, and in the suppression of Aurora B kinase activity. The resulting suppression of Aurora B kinase activity inhibits a number of events that are required for progression through mitosis and thus causes cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The drug is also shown to inhibit the binding of the Aurora B kinase to microtubules. This inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity, and its effect on micro

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Nolvadex is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Nolvadex is based on the competitive inhibition of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. Nolvadex belongs to the class of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs are a group of compounds that have two or more binding sites on the estrogen receptor (ER), one that is responsible for binding the hormone and the other that is responsible for the induction of the response to the hormone. This property is called partial agonism.
The combination of estrogen and progestin is more effective than estrogen alone in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the combination of estrogen and progestin has a number of undesirable side effects, such as an increase in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. In addition, it is a known fact that the combination of estrogen and progestin may increase the risk of breast cancer in some women.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Noradrenaline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Noradrenaline is by activation of α1 receptors (α1-AR) and β1-AR. In the heart and vasculature, α1-AR mediate positive inotropic and chronotropic effects and β1-AR are responsible for vascular constriction. The β2-AR are found in the lung, heart, and gastrointestinal tract where they mediate relaxation of smooth muscle, relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. The β3-AR is found in the heart, bladder, and gastrointestinal tract where it is responsible for relaxation of smooth muscle and stimulation of insulin release. The β3-AR is expressed in the vasculature where it mediates vasodilation. (Fagan, J. M. et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 33:165-202 (1993)).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of norethindrone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of norethindrone is similar to that of other progestogens, which is to bind to the androgen receptor (AR) and exert their action through a complex pathway. This process involves binding to the AR and formation of a complex with the DNA-binding domain, which is followed by recruitment of coactivators and subsequent transactivation. Norethindrone binds to the AR in a similar manner to progesterone, and this binding is followed by the recruitment of a series of coactivators, including the transcriptional coactivator AIB1, which stimulates the interaction of the AR with the transcriptional complex.^[@B1]^ A similar process occurs in the presence of norethindrone, and this interaction is accompanied by the activation of transcription and the expression of several genes, including those encoding for proteins that regulate steroidogenesis.^[@B2]^

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Obeticholic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Obeticholic is not clear, and there are some important unanswered questions. There are two points of view in this debate:

The traditional position: that bile acid synthesis is required for cholesterol to be metabolized by the liver.

The alternative position: that bile acid synthesis is not required for cholesterol to be metabolized by the liver.

Traditional position

The classic example of this position is the discovery of cholesterol in the bile, and the belief that the bile had a role in the metabolism of cholesterol. The liver synthesizes cholesterol, and when cholesterol is taken up by the liver, bile acids are synthesized in the liver. If the bile is secreted into the intestine, cholesterol is dissolved and bile acids are secreted into the intestine. If the bile is secreted into the intestine, bile acids are dissolved and cholesterol is reabsorbed into the intestine. If the bile is secreted

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Octanoic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Octanoic is also interesting. We know from the EPAA Report (2011) that, according to EU-funded research, “the octanoic acid ester group [in Octanoic] is responsible for a number of its bioactivities” (p. 24). This group “inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of the body’s own endocannabinoids” (ibid).

The body’s own endocannabinoids are produced by the human body and function as chemical messengers in the brain and the endocrine system. They are used by the body to communicate with itself and with the brain and nervous system, to regulate metabolism, and to produce feelings of well-being. They are involved in the immune system, the regulation of the heart, and the cardiovascular system, the regulation of appetite, and the regulation of the hormonal system.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of octocrylene is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of octocrylene is not fully understood. However, a direct mechanism involving covalent binding of the peroxide bridge to DNA, as well as a mechanism involving formation of a long-lived radical cation (which is highly reactive towards DNA), have been proposed (1). Both mechanisms can be associated with the photochemical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the formation of free radicals (FRs) and covalent DNA adducts (1,2).

It has been reported that octocrylene is rapidly absorbed through the skin, and the absorption is facilitated by the presence of a sunscreen. The high concentration of octocrylene in the skin (as high as 0.7 μmol/cm(2)) means that the amount of this chemical penetrating the skin in the day time is significant. The dermal penetration is fast, and in the case of the octocrylene, its rate of penetration is almost the same as that of oxy

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of (+,-)-Octopamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of (+,-)-Octopamine is not well understood. It is known to be an invertebrate biogenic amine, and acts on invertebrate nervous systems and on mammalian adrenergic receptors. The mammalian adrenergic receptors have been classified into two major subtypes, called alpha and beta. Both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors mediate the action of the catecholamines, noradrenaline and adrenaline. More recently, further subtypes of the alpha adrenergic receptors have been defined. These include alpha 1D, alpha 1B, and alpha 1L. Each subtype has a unique distribution, both at the mRNA and protein level.
The functional alpha 1D adrenergic receptor has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in cell lines. When expressed in CHO cells, the receptor is coupled to the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis via the activation of G proteins (Singh B. K., et al., Mol.

ODM-201 inhibits nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity by preventing the binding of the enzyme to p22phox. ODM-201 does not prevent the enzyme from forming a complex with p47phox and p67phox, but prevents the translocation of the enzyme complex to the cell membrane. ODM-201 has no effect on the enzyme complex that lacks p22phox, but it prevents the enzyme complex from activating Rac and p47phox.

Clinical trials

ODM-201 was studied in a phase I trial for the treatment of heart failure. ODM-201 was given intravenously as a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg to ten patients with heart failure. The patients had a mean age of 66 years, a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, and a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ODM-203 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ODM-203 is similar to that of diuretics and beta blockers. When the heart is challenged by volume overload or increased left ventricular afterload, the beta-2 adrenergic receptor activates adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, thereby causing a decrease in vasopressin release. In addition, the decrease in cAMP activates the Na^+^/H^+^ antiporter, resulting in a decrease in intracellular pH and increased urinary sodium excretion ([@b1-vhrm-4-1361]).

ODM-203 is a selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which acts by activating adenylate cyclase in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, resulting in increased production of cAMP. It is currently under investigation for the treatment

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ofloxacin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ofloxacin is as follows. Ofloxacin is a broad spectrum, anti-bacterial agent that has been found to be effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Ofloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase. This enzyme is responsible for relieving the negative supercoils of DNA, and allowing it to relax. Ofloxacin works by binding to DNA gyrase and inhibits the supercoiling activity of the enzyme. Inhibition of this enzyme results in the missegregation of DNA and cell death. Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, S-Ofloxacin and R-Ofloxacin. The R-Ofloxacin enantiomer has been found to be the most potent of the two enantiomers. The R-Ofloxacin enantiomer has a 10-20 fold

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oleuropein is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oleuropein is not yet fully understood, but the Oleuropein is known to be a polyphenol and as such is thought to inhibit tumor growth by altering tumor cell proliferation and/or apoptosis \[[@B14]\]. Oleuropein has also been shown to reduce tumor growth in animal models by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Oleuropein has been shown to be an effective chemopreventive agent in the gastrointestinal tract \[[@B15]\] and the brain \[[@B16]\]. Our study found that Oleuropein, when given alone, is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in primary cortical neurons. However, in the presence of CPT, a model for chemotherapy, the combination of Oleuropein and CPT synergistically induces apoptosis. This finding is supported by the study of our group that showed that Oleuropein reduces the resistance of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oltipraz is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oltipraz is believed to be due to its antioxidant and chelating properties. The oxidative stress in the gut of mice, which can cause gut damage and even lead to apoptosis, is reduced by Oltipraz.

Anti-carcinogenic effects
The anti-carcinogenic effect of Oltipraz is thought to be due to the ability of the drug to suppress tumour growth and tumour invasion. This is likely due to the antioxidant properties of the drug, which also inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis.

Immunomodulatory effects
Oltipraz is thought to inhibit the NF-κB pathway and inhibit activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of OMNISCAN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of OMNISCAN is based on the recognition of the fact that the key driver of the disease process is a cytokine imbalance between the Th1 and Th2 immune responses. This imbalance can be quantified by measuring a number of Th1/Th2 biomarkers, such as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, TNF-α, and TGF-β. OMNISCAN recognizes these cytokines as key to identifying the disease progression and to monitoring the patient's response to treatment. OMNISCAN, in conjunction with a proprietary, high-resolution Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay platform, analyzes patient samples in a single run. The analyte levels are correlated with a number of important clinical measures, including duration of the disease, level of T-cell activation, clinical disease progression, and the response to therapy.

The binding of OROTIC to the mitochondrial membrane leads to opening of the mitochondrial ATP‐sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP) and to inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation. MitoKATP activation causes an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and a decrease in the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial matrix. This leads to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the induction of the expression of several antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 is also activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~) or nitric oxide (NO). In fact, Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) present in the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Otilonium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Otilonium is based on the unique properties of its constituent, oxotilion. Oxotilion binds to the muscarinic receptor and activates the receptor in a similar manner to acetylcholine. However, the primary difference between the two molecules is that oxotilion has a much longer half-life in vivo than acetylcholine, resulting in prolonged receptor activation.

Otilonium was originally developed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), but its use in this indication has been limited by side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and fatigue. In 2011, the FDA approved Otilonium as an adjunct to desmopressin (Minirin) for the treatment of nocturia in patients with type II diabetes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of OTX015 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of OTX015 is not yet fully understood. OTX015 inhibits HIF1α degradation by targeting the SCF^βTRCP^ E3 ligase.^[@R4]^ HIF1α is stabilized under normoxic conditions and promotes the expression of the glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase (HK) II,^[@R6]^ and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)^[@R7]^ which play important roles in cancer cell growth and tumor angiogenesis. In addition, HIF1α has been shown to promote the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by regulating the expression of mitochondrial genes, such as *ND1* (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1), *ND2* (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2), and *COX2* (Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2).^[

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ouabain is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ouabain is not clear. However, its binding to Na^+^/K^+^-ATPase causes a conformational change in the pump, which then inhibits ATP hydrolysis. Ouabain causes an increase in cytoplasmic Ca^2+^, and it is possible that this increases cytoplasmic Na^+^ by activation of Na^+^/Ca^2+^ exchange. Ouabain causes an increase in cytoplasmic Na^+^ by activation of Na^+^/Ca^2+^ exchange. This increase in Na^+^/Ca^2+^ exchange may increase Ca^2+^ influx through the plasma membrane Ca^2+^ channels, and increase the Ca^2+^ content of the ER. The latter causes activation of Ca^2+^-dependent enzymes and stimulates protein synthesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oxacillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oxacillin is related to the ability of the molecule to form a covalent bond with the terminal amino group of the peptidoglycan, a crucial step for the bacterial cell wall synthesis \[[@B28-molecules-24-03247]\]. The main disadvantage of this antibiotic is the high resistance of the bacteria that are capable of degrading the antibiotics, but also of developing the resistance by reducing the permeability of the membrane, increasing the efflux pump, and other mechanisms. The effect of oxacillin is a result of the inhibition of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) involved in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan. The B1 and B2 PBPs have a higher affinity for oxacillin than the B3 PBP. The low concentrations of oxacillin have a bacteriostatic effect, while the higher concentrations are bactericidal \[[@B29-molecules-24-03

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oxantel is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oxantel is not completely known, but it seems to inhibit a membrane transporter, Oxantel-sensitive potassium channels.  This action results in hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and subsequently, paralysis of the central nervous system.  Oxantel's mechanism of action is similar to that of a muscle relaxant, and can be used in combination with other medications that act on the same target.

Therapeutic use
Oxantel is used for treatment of tapeworms in cats and dogs.  It is also used in humans as an antiparasitic treatment for tapeworm infections.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oxaprozin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oxaprozin is believed to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins. Inhibition of COX may also be responsible for the analgesic activity of the drug. Inhibition of COX results in a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, which may contribute to the inhibition of inflammation and pain. The drug is thought to be useful for the treatment of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and psoriasis.

Interactions

Drug interactions

Although Oxaprozin has not been systematically studied in vivo, there is a report of interaction with several anticonvulsants and anti-inflammatory drugs.

Animal studies

Response: The mechanism of action of Oxybuprocaine is not yet clear. It has been shown that, in addition to local anesthetic action, it also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In the present study, the authors investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the effects of Oxybuprocaine on experimental colitis. They found that in Oxybuprocaine-treated rats, there was a significant increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38MAPK in the colon compared with untreated colitis rats. Oxybuprocaine also reduced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the colon.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Oxymatrine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Oxymatrine is not yet fully understood. However, the evidence available suggests that it acts through the stimulation of the activation of glycogenolysis, which leads to an increase in glycogen content in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. This is important, because these tissues store glycogen in their cellular reserve and play a crucial role in maintaining normal energy homeostasis. Therefore, Oxymatrine is beneficial in obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, because it increases the glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and increases insulin sensitivity in the liver.\[[@ref1][@ref2][@ref3][@ref4][@ref5]\]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of OXYTROL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of OXYTROL is not known. It is possible that it works in a similar way to other anesthetic gases, by a change in the ionic concentration of the membrane, and that it is not specific to the site of action. In the clinical studies in human volunteers, OXYTROL produced rapid and complete analgesia, with a maximum effect of approximately 30 minutes. It is used in combination with other analgesic agents, including opioids, and is also used in combination with sedatives and analgesics for sedation and analgesia during endoscopy. It is not suitable for use in pregnant women.

OVERDOSAGE

The possibility of overdose in patients with chronic pain syndrome cannot be excluded.

ADVERSE EFFECTS

In controlled clinical trials in human volunteers, OXYTROL was well tolerated.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ozagrel is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ozagrel is believed to be similar to that of other platelet aggregation inhibitors, but unlike these, Ozagrel does not have an effect on ADP-induced aggregation. Ozagrel does not affect platelet adhesion, spreading, or secretion of granules. However, it is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation in response to collagen. In the presence of platelet activating factor, Ozagrel inhibits aggregation induced by all agonists tested, including ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid. In vitro, Ozagrel has been shown to inhibit the binding of [3H]U-46619, a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor agonist, to its receptor on washed rabbit platelets. Ozagrel is a potent inhibitor of TXA2 production in washed rabbit platelets stimulated with arachidonic acid. Ozagrel also inhibits the release of serotonin and ATP from platelets.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ozenoxacin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ozenoxacin is not completely understood, however, the compound is believed to act by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Inhibition of gyrase results in the inability of the bacteria to replicate and form colonies. The resulting growth inhibition is due to the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks. In addition, the compound is also believed to cause the death of the bacterial cell by disruption of the bacterial membrane.

Aminoglycosides are a class of broad spectrum antibiotics that have been used for over 50 years to treat bacterial infections. They are believed to function by binding to the bacterial ribosome and interfering with protein synthesis.

In addition to the inhibition of the proliferation and survival of B cells, Pacritinib also inhibits other cells involved in the inflammatory response.

The activity of Pacritinib in vitro was assessed in cell lines and primary human cells. Pacritinib inhibited the growth of a number of cancer cell lines, with GI50 values in the range of 0.01 to 2.6 μM. Pacritinib inhibited the growth of B-cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines that are driven by BCR signaling. Pacritinib also inhibited proliferation of cell lines driven by other pathways, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pamidronate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pamidronate is poorly understood. Some reports suggest that the drug can reduce the level of free calcium in the bone tissue. In addition, it has been suggested that Pamidronate can also prevent bone resorption by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts. Other studies have suggested that Pamidronate can reduce the activity of osteoclasts by inducing apoptosis.

Another bone agent that has been used to treat osteoporosis is zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid is an analogue of pamidronate and is administered as a single infusion of 4 mg. Zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite and prevents the binding of calcium to the hydroxyapatite crystals. The mechanism of action of zoledronic acid is similar to that of pamidronate.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pancuronium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pancuronium is poorly understood. It has been postulated that the block is due to the release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerves, inhibition of the release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve endings, or a combination of both mechanisms.\[[@ref1]\]

Pancuronium is a rapidly acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, which has been used since the 1960s for neuromuscular blockade. It is a steroidal, cyclic aminosteroid, with a molecular weight of 430.9. It is a member of the achiral, pyrrolidine ring system, with a chiral carbon at the center of the molecule. Pancuronium is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion of approximately 0.1 mg/kg/min. It is also available as an intramuscular (IM) injection, administered at a dose of

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Paromomycin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Paromomycin is well understood and involves interference with the peptidyl transferase centre of the 50S ribosomal subunit (Wang et al., [@B42]; Bose et al., [@B4]). It is effective against a broad range of bacterial species, including Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, mycobacteria and yeast (Taha et al., [@B40]). Despite this wide spectrum of activity, it is well tolerated by mammalian cells and no adverse side effects have been reported (Hu et al., [@B16]).

As a result of its promising properties, Paromomycin has been tested in a wide range of infectious diseases. In particular, it has been extensively used in the treatment of severe forms of the chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency syndrome that predisposes to severe, often life threatening, infections with catalase-positive bacteria.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Paroxetine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Paroxetine is believed to be based on a selective inhibition of the uptake of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) into platelets. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,203 to Zis.
However, it is believed that in many patients Paroxetine is not an effective antidepressant because it is absorbed poorly and/or is metabolized in the liver to a compound which is active in the central nervous system.
The compound of this invention is a selective inhibitor of the uptake of 5-HT into platelets, and it is believed that this compound does not exhibit the above-described disadvantages of Paroxetine.
Paroxetine has been described in a number of references, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,007,203, 4,145,434, 4,155,859, 4,256,716, 4,256

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of p-Benzoquinone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of p-Benzoquinone is known as being one of the ways in which a bacterial cell is killed. The bacterium is able to absorb the quinone from the environment and use it as an electron acceptor to produce ATP, which then leads to cell death.

One of the problems with using antibiotics is that many bacteria have become resistant to the drugs used to kill them. In order to find a way to deal with this problem, researchers have been trying to find new drugs.

As a result, p-Benzoquinone has been found to be useful as an antibiotic. It kills bacteria by causing damage to the cell membrane. This leads to a loss of water and other molecules, and this causes the cell to burst.

As well as being an antibiotic, p-Benzoquinone has also been found to be useful in treating infections caused by certain types of cancer. This is because it is able to induce apoptosis (

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PCI-32765 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PCI-32765 is not yet fully understood, but we suspect that the ligand and/or the ligand-receptor complex can cause some cell death through apoptosis and necrosis, as previously observed for inhibitors of PI3K \[[@CR18]\].

It is likely that our findings with PCI-32765 can be extrapolated to other B-RAF inhibitors that act on the same binding site, such as dabrafenib, trametinib and Vemurafenib. We are currently testing this hypothesis in several BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines.

We have also evaluated the combination of PCI-32765 with trametinib and with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. As expected, the combination of these inhibitors induced a synergistic reduction of cell viability.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of p-Cresol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of p-Cresol is not fully understood. It is hypothesized that p-Cresol induces its toxic effects via inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport. This is further supported by the observations that inhibition of p-Cresol transport to the mitochondria with resveratrol can prevent the toxic effects of p-Cresol \[[@B41-ijms-21-04805]\].

One of the proposed mechanisms for the action of p-Cresol is the direct inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme \[[@B42-ijms-21-04805]\]. It is hypothesized that p-Cresol interferes with the CYP3A4 active site by blocking substrate binding.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pemetrexed is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pemetrexed is not completely understood. In vitro studies have shown that Pemetrexed binds to and stabilizes the p53 protein, which is an important protein that regulates cell cycle and apoptosis. Studies have shown that Pemetrexed can lead to a decreased level of p53 protein. In some patients, the decrease in p53 protein levels can be enough to stop the cell cycle and allow the cancer cells to stop dividing.

If you have been diagnosed with mesothelioma, it is important to talk to a doctor who has experience with mesothelioma and Pemetrexed. Your doctor may be able to tell you whether Pemetrexed can help you and if you should continue with Pemetrexed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pemirolast is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pemirolast is not completely understood. However, there are a few possible explanations for the anti-inflammatory effects of Pemirolast. The anti-inflammatory action of Pemirolast may be due to inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a major enzyme involved in the arachidonic acid cascade. This is the mechanism that Pemirolast uses to inhibit the release of mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. Pemirolast also inhibits the activity of the PLA2 enzyme. Pemirolast is an antagonist of the PAF receptor and blocks the action of PAF. PAF is a mediator released by inflammatory cells. PAF causes bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and an influx of inflammatory cells into the airways. PAF has also been implicated in the induction of bronchial hyperreactivity. This may be due to PAF increasing the release of hist

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PF-00080665 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PF-00080665 is via the inhibition of c-Src and VEGFR2, the two kinases that activate the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, respectively, and downstream effectors. c-Src phosphorylates Tyr1047 on Cdc42 (Tyr1041 on Cdc42-3) and Tyr527 on Rac1 (Tyr521 on Rac1-3), which promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP and results in the activation of Cdc42 and Rac. Inhibition of c-Src reduces Cdc42 and Rac activation, leading to a decrease in downstream signaling pathways, including activation of the ERK, Akt, and RhoA/ROCK pathways, and a subsequent decrease in cell proliferation and invasion.[@b17-dddt-9-1469],[@b18-dddt-9-1469] VEGFR2 is a trans

Response: The mechanism of action of PF-05208749 is complex, and is related to the inhibition of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptors. Both CXCR4 and CCR5 are required for the entry of HIV into cells and are required for the establishment and maintenance of viral infection. PF-05208749 has been shown to be a potent CCR5 antagonist and an effective CXCR4 inhibitor in vitro. In vivo, PF-05208749 is active in animal models of HIV infection. In addition, PF-05208749 inhibits the replication of several other viruses, including West Nile virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus and herpes simplex virus.
PF-05208749 was initially discovered by Merck and Co., Inc. and is being developed by Pfizer Inc.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PF-06463922 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PF-06463922 is not yet understood. In fact, only one study so far has reported the effects of PF-06463922 in a mammalian cell line (HepG2), where the drug inhibited GSK3β activity and increased the phosphorylation of tau protein (He et al., [@B26]). However, these effects have not been observed in a *Drosophila* model of tauopathies (Van der Perren et al., [@B66]), in which the compound induced a modest neurodegenerative phenotype. PF-06463922 could act on the flies via GSK3β-independent mechanisms, and/or by increasing the activity of the pathway. A GSK3β-independent mechanism would be compatible with the mild effects observed in tauopathies. However, it is unlikely that PF-06463922 increases the activity of the GSK3β pathway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PF-2341066 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PF-2341066 is through inhibition of the ERK pathway. This drug blocks the ERK pathway, which is a critical pathway in mediating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is an ATP competitive inhibitor of the MEK enzyme, and therefore inhibits ERK phosphorylation. PF-2341066 also inhibits several other kinases, including members of the JNK, AKT, and mTOR pathways. PF-2341066 has been tested in phase I clinical trials in combination with other agents, such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.

There are also several phase II trials in the US and Europe, which have been completed, or are ongoing, for PF-2341066 in combination with various chemotherapies and biologic agents.

Response: The mechanism of action of Phenoxybenzamine is not well understood. The drug has been used clinically for decades as a vasodilator in patients with arteriovenous fistulas and for treating Raynaud's disease. The drug is a competitive antagonist of alpha1-adrenergic receptors, a class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) found on the surface of cells throughout the body.
The binding of a ligand to the GPCR initiates a cascade of events that begins with the binding of the ligand to the GPCR, which in turn activates a heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The activated G-protein complex causes a conformational change in the GPCR that results in its activation. Once activated, the GPCR coupled to the G-protein complex stimulates an effector protein. The effector protein is responsible for translating the signal to the final cellular response.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Phensuximide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Phensuximide is not well understood. Its action is thought to be the result of a partial agonist action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. Phensuximide, a novel anti-seizure drug, was tested in a series of experiments on two distinct models of epilepsy. Phensuximide was found to be effective in preventing seizures induced by intracortical stimulation of the limbic system in the rat. It was also effective in the genetic seizure model of the DBA/2 mouse. Phensuximide was shown to be a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine site on the GABA receptor. This study demonstrates that Phensuximide is effective in preventing seizures in both genetic and experimental models of epilepsy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Phenylglyoxylic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Phenylglyoxylic isothiocyanate (PGITC) has been recently clarified by our laboratory and others. PGITC inhibits the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) and downregulates expression of genes activated by this transcription factor. This inhibition results in downregulation of growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and it has been proposed that PGITC exerts its effects by modulating growth factor signaling through inhibition of AP-1. Our laboratory has previously shown that PGITC treatment leads to increased apoptosis of rat glioma cells and rat astrocytes, and to inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. PGITC has also been shown to reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in glioma cells and rat astrocytes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Phenytoin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Phenytoin is still not completely understood, but its activity appears to be related to its ability to enhance the effects of GABA, the inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. This effect on the GABA system is the probable basis of the anticonvulsant activity of Phenytoin. Phenytoin is a racemic mixture of R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers, the R-enantiomer being the more active.

**Site of Action**

Phenytoin acts by enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA. The mode of action is thought to be at the receptor level.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Phenytoin is well absorbed from the GI tract. Its peak plasma concentration occurs within 2 to 4 hours after administration and is due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Protein binding is about 40%. Peak concentrations are reached in approximately 12 hours. The drug is distributed

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Picrotoxinin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Picrotoxinin is poorly understood. It has been shown to be an antagonist at the GABA~A~ receptor, the main inhibitory receptor of the brain. However, the mechanism by which it works at the receptor level is unknown. It may block the receptor by binding to the agonist site, but it may also act on the channel. Another possibility is that Picrotoxinin may have a direct effect on the GABA~A~ receptor and thus block the channel by a different mechanism.

Picrotoxinin, a derivative of the marine sponge *Ircinia* sp., has been known since the 1950s. The first in vitro studies on the anticonvulsant activity of the substance were published in 1971 by Huang and Thannickal\[[@ref1]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pimavanserin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pimavanserin is not yet fully understood. One proposed mechanism is a reduction in dopamine release in the brain, resulting in decreased serotonin activity in the striatum. Other proposed mechanisms include decreased glutamate release and activity, as well as an increase in GABA activity in the brain. Pimavanserin is also believed to reduce the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pimobendan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pimobendan is to increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to calcium and inotropic agents and to decrease the calcium content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus increasing the systolic force of contraction and reducing the diastolic tension. These effects are exerted through the increase of myosin light chain kinase activity. This enzyme is activated by calcium ions and is involved in the regulation of myocardial contractility, via its phosphorylation of the 20 kDa light chain of myosin. Pimobendan is an imidazolium compound with a pyrrolidine moiety and two phenyl moieties. The imidazolium moiety confers the activity of the drug on the myocardium, whereas the phenyl moieties may exert a modulatory effect.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pinacidil is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pinacidil is still unknown. It has been suggested that the agent might act by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane. This hypothesis is based on the fact that Pinacidil causes vasodilation in the presence of submaximal concentrations of norepinephrine and is unaffected by the autonomic nervous system. Pinacidil is not known to have any serious side effects. It is generally well tolerated, and it does not appear to cause hypotension. In some patients, the drug may cause headache and a warm sensation in the palms of the hands. It may also produce symptoms of cardiac ischemia such as chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and anxiety.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pircetam is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pircetam is currently unknown, but it is thought to inhibit the P-gp protein (P-glycoprotein) located in the intestinal wall and liver. This causes the P-gp to lose its function, allowing the medication to enter the bloodstream.

Mechanism of Action

Pircetam is a type of medication called a "prodrug." This means that the medication is inactive in the body until it is metabolized by the liver and intestines. When the medication reaches the intestines, the P-gp is located in the intestines. This protein acts as a barrier, which prevents the medication from passing into the body.

When Pircetam reaches the intestines, it is converted into its active form. The active form of the medication is not P-gp's substrate, so the medication is not affected by the P-gp protein. Once in the intestines, the medication is absorbed into the bloodstream.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pitavastatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pitavastatin is thought to be as follows: Pitavastatin is converted to its active form, pitavastatin lactone, by esterase in the liver. Pitavastatin lactone inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and lowers cholesterol levels. In addition, pitavastatin has various pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-allergic, and anti-thrombotic effects, and it has a low incidence of side effects such as elevation of transaminase levels and the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis. Thus, Pitavastatin is a safe drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Non Patent Literature 1).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pitolisant is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pitolisant is unknown. However, it is hypothesized to inhibit histamine H1 receptors in the hypothalamus, reducing the release of histamine and, hence, suppressing appetite and inducing weight loss. It is an agonist at H1 and H2 receptors and a weak inverse agonist at H3 receptors. It is also a selective antagonist at H3 receptors and an antagonist at H4 receptors.

It is used in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, in addition to other sleep disorders. It is also used in the treatment of schizophrenia, as an appetite suppressant and to reduce the weight of people with HIV/AIDS. It is under development for the treatment of alcoholism and substance dependence, as an anti-obesity agent, and to treat obesity. It has also been proposed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction and menopausal symptoms.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Pizotifen is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Pizotifen is not yet fully understood. It is believed that the drug acts as an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor. Pizotifen is a very effective treatment for at least certain forms of migraine. In addition to migraine, the H1 antagonist action of Pizotifen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of allergies and motion sickness.
Pizotifen is currently available in a 50 mg oral tablet. This dose is effective in treating migraine. A 50 mg dose of Pizotifen taken once daily is generally considered to be effective for the treatment of migraine. However, 50 mg of Pizotifen taken once daily may not be sufficient to adequately treat many forms of migraine.
There is a need in the art for improved compositions and methods for the treatment of migraine and other disorders responsive to H1 receptor antagonists. The present invention addresses this need.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PLX-4032 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PLX-4032 is by directly targeting mutant *BRAF* and blocking the downstream pathway ([@bib6]). Patients with advanced melanoma with *BRAF* V600 mutations, including melanoma with *BRAF* V600E mutation, are most likely to respond to PLX-4032. Other *BRAF* V600 mutations, such as V600K and V600R, have been identified in patients with melanoma ([@bib4]; [@bib12]; [@bib2]; [@bib14]).

In this study, we report a patient with metastatic melanoma with a V600E *BRAF* mutation who achieved a partial response to the BRAF inhibitor PLX-4032. In addition, the patient had prolonged disease control with the combination of BRAF inhibitor and immune checkpoint blockade.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PLX8394 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PLX8394 is unknown but may be through inactivation of the NF-κB pathway by the inhibition of upstream kinases.^[@bib5]^ Furthermore, PLX8394 also inhibits the synthesis of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and the inactivation of the oncogenic transcription factor Myc.^[@bib5]^ Thus, in addition to targeting an oncogenic transcription factor, PLX8394 is also targeting the inactivation of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in melanoma cells.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PLX8394 is an orally bioavailable, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the kinase TBK1 that effectively inhibits melanoma cell growth *in vitro* and *in vivo*. PLX8394 was well tolerated in patients, and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal events and fatigue. In summary, these data support further investigation of PLX8394

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Polydatin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Polydatin is not completely understood. It is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by a variety of pathways. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of the Polydatin is still not fully understood.

Many studies have shown that Polydatin has the ability to induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in various cancer cells \[[@CR26]--[@CR29]\]. The G0/G1 phase is the time of cell growth and proliferation. The ability of Polydatin to induce G0/G1 arrest is considered to be the mechanism of its anti-cancer effect.

In our study, we observed the anti-cancer effect of Polydatin in several cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrated that Polydatin significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner. This result is consistent with previous studies \[[@CR26

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Polymyxin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Polymyxin is not well understood. However, it is generally accepted that the mechanism involves the disruption of the bacterial membrane.
The bactericidal effect of Polymyxin has been attributed to a detergent-like action on the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, with a marked selectivity for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Stender et al., "Bactericidal Effect of Polymyxin B on Gram-negative Bacteria", Microbiology, Vol. 13, pp. 2187-2192, 1977). Polymyxin appears to disrupt the LPS portion of the outer membrane by interfering with the lipid A component.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ponesimod is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ponesimod is not completely understood, but it is thought to be due to inhibition of lymphocyte activation and trafficking. Ponesimod blocks the interaction between sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor, which is found on lymphocytes, and which stimulates lymphocyte activation. Blocking this interaction inhibits the ability of lymphocytes to travel from lymphoid organs to the sites of inflammation. The effectiveness of Ponesimod is dependent on the number of lymphocytes in the blood.

As with other immunosuppressants, the long-term use of Ponesimod is associated with a risk of infection, particularly with viral infections. Ponesimod has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with hematological malignancies who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of prasugrel is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of prasugrel is thought to be related to inhibition of the active metabolite, R-138727, and other metabolites, by blocking platelet P2Y~12~ receptors \[[@b1]\]. When patients are treated with prasugrel, an initial dose of 10 mg is recommended, and the maintenance dose should be reduced to 5 mg in patients with an initial ADP-induced platelet aggregation (PA) \<20% or a PA of ≥20% at 60 min. In this case, a dose reduction is required for two reasons. First, it is known that platelet activity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) decreases after a coronary intervention, even if the procedure was successful \[[@b2]\]. In this situation, the effect of prasugrel is likely to be insufficient, which may lead to thrombotic events. Second, a dose reduction for patients with a low AD

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Prilocaine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Prilocaine is based on the blockage of sodium channels and therefore its use in local anesthesia is very well known. Its use in electro-physiology is also well known, but in such use its application is limited to epineural blocks. The present invention describes the use of Prilocaine for the induction of general anesthesia.
The mechanism of action of sodium channel blockers is based on the fact that these compounds interact with the voltage dependent sodium channels. This interaction is such that the current passing through the sodium channels is blocked.
The voltage dependent sodium channels are of two types:
(1) The voltage dependent inactivated type of channels.
(2) The voltage dependent active type of channels.
The inactivated type of channels is described in detail in Chapter 5 of “The Ion Channel of Excitable Membranes” by Douglas E.N. Pace and David G. Nicholls, published by Chapman and Hall (1994).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Procaterol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Procaterol is not known. Procaterol inhibits the adenylate cyclase of the heart, leading to a decrease in the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, which in turn reduces the force of contraction of the heart. The heart is a muscle and as such it is subjected to physical forces. It is not uncommon for the heart to fail when subjected to these forces. If this occurs, the patient will often die. Procaterol has been shown to be effective in the treatment of such conditions as congestive heart failure and myocardial ischemia.

Drug Description

Procaterol, an inhaled bronchodilator, is used to treat the following conditions:

Angina pectoris

Asthma

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of procyclidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of procyclidine is not yet completely understood.
Procyclidine hydrochloride (1,1-diphenyl-2-propylpiperidine hydrochloride) has been used for several years in the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, tardive dyskinesia, and alcohol withdrawal. Procyclidine has been found to block the synaptic transmission of excitatory amino acids in the brain, especially at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The binding of NMDA to its receptor is a complex process, and there are at least three sites of action: the ligand binding site, the glycine modulatory site, and the ion channel. Procyclidine has been found to bind to the ligand binding site of the NMDA receptor, and is thought to act as an antagonist. Procyclidine may be effective in the treatment of a number of disorders by blocking the action

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Propranolol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Propranolol is not well understood, but it is assumed to inhibit the beta receptors. Beta adrenergic receptors are membrane receptors that mediate the actions of catecholamines, particularly epinephrine and norepinephrine. Beta adrenergic receptors are present in the myocardium, and are involved in the stimulation of heart rate, contractility, and vasoconstriction. Propranolol, like other beta blockers, inhibits these actions by blocking the beta receptors. Propranolol is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.
The R(+) enantiomer of propranolol has been found to be therapeutically superior to the S(−) enantiomer. The S(−) enantiomer has been found to be about ten times more potent than the R(+) enantiomer in binding to beta receptors, and has little if any activity in inhibiting peripheral beta receptors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of p-Toluenesulfonic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of p-Toluenesulfonic is commonly referred to as "high pressure sulphonation" (HPS) and is a well-known and useful process for the manufacture of a variety of sulfonated aromatic compounds and their derivatives. For example, HPS is used to manufacture para-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) and para-Toluenesulfonate salt.
The mechanism of HPS involves the conversion of aromatic compounds to aromatic sulfonic acids and salts by reacting aromatic compounds with sulfur trioxide. The reaction occurs at temperatures of 200.degree.-400.degree. C. and pressures of 10-40 atmospheres in the presence of hydrogen fluoride and a suitable catalyst. The sulfonation reaction is typically carried out in a two-step process, i.e., sulfonation and hydrolysis, with the sulfonation step usually being carried out at temperatures of 250.degree.-350.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of PYRAZINAMIDE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of PYRAZINAMIDE is not fully understood. It is not thought to be a competitive inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dihydroorotate from orotate. PYRAZINAMIDE is thought to inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) by covalently modifying its essential active site cysteine residue. This leads to inhibition of the mitochondrial enzyme and consequently inhibition of the biosynthesis of uridine monophosphate (UMP) and dUMP. The inhibition of UMP biosynthesis is responsible for the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of R is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of R is still unclear. One hypothesis is that R might interact with the cell membrane or nuclear receptors. Our laboratory has found that R interacts with and regulates the expression of the transcription factor NF-kB in endothelial cells. NF-kB is an important transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell survival, inflammation, and immunity. R downregulates the expression of the NF-kB subunit p65 by increasing its association with the IkBa subunit. The interaction of R with the NF-kB subunit p65 is in part mediated by the first helix of the R domain and the third helix of the EGF domain. This interaction is blocked by peptides that correspond to the first helix of the R domain and the third helix of the EGF domain. Our results suggest that R might act by altering the transcriptional activity of NF-kB. The peptides that block the interaction of R with the NF-kB subunit

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of R406 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of R406 is to bind to the allosteric pocket of a target protein, thereby inducing conformational changes in the protein. This ultimately leads to inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the target protein. The allosteric binding site of protein kinases is a deep cleft that lies between the two lobes of the kinase domain and is bordered by the glycine-rich loop, the αC helix, and the β3 strand. R406 binds to the allosteric pocket in a competitive manner and inhibits protein kinase activity by preventing the binding of substrates and/or ATP. The binding of R406 to protein kinases has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of a variety of protein kinases including Src, Fyn, Btk, TEC, Fes, Lck, Blk, HCK, and FLT3 \[[@B9-ijms-19-00139],[@B11

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of ractopamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of ractopamine is based on the ability of this drug to selectively increase the rate of protein synthesis by increasing ribosome biogenesis and inhibiting protein degradation. The effect of ractopamine on the muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is observed after a single dose and remains elevated for up to 72 h. Ractopamine increases the MPS of muscle protein and increases the plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in a dose-dependent manner. Ractopamine increases the MPS of skeletal muscle by enhancing the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. This leads to increased ribosome biogenesis, increased translation, and increased translation initiation of mRNA. The increased IGF-1 in the plasma also activates the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Radotinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Radotinib is based on its capability to block the activity of the ATP binding domain of Bcr-Abl, a fusion protein that is produced by a chromosomal translocation (t (9;22) (q34;q11) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and t (1;19) (q23;p13) in chronic myeloid leukemia. The fusion protein is constitutively active and induces the phosphorylation of a variety of downstream targets, leading to cell cycle progression, apoptosis and inhibition of cell differentiation. Radotinib was found to be highly effective in inhibiting the growth of both Bcr-Abl positive and negative leukemia cells, in preclinical models of leukemia and in patients with CML in chronic phase and blast phase. Radotinib showed a high therapeutic index in a dose-dependent manner, with minimal side effects and it was shown to be active in patients resistant to prior TKIs. In addition

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RAPAMYCIN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RAPAMYCIN is not fully understood. RAPAMYCIN may cause the death of tumor cells by the induction of apoptosis, by inhibiting protein synthesis, or by arresting cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. However, RAPAMYCIN may also cause the death of normal cells. The ability of RAPAMYCIN to induce apoptosis is mediated by its interaction with a number of cellular proteins. These proteins include the peptide p53, the BCL-2 protein family, and the proto-oncogene c-myc. RAPAMYCIN may also inhibit the protein synthesis of tumor cells by interfering with the function of certain ribosomal proteins.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Reboxetine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Reboxetine is currently unknown. Reboxetine may inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, thus elevating the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Alternatively, it may have additional actions. Reboxetine has been shown to potentiate the anticonvulsant effect of gabapentin, the anticonvulsant properties of which are thought to be mediated by the enhancement of GABA release. Reboxetine may also have effects on the binding of benzodiazepines and their receptor complexes. Reboxetine has been shown to inhibit the uptake of the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline. Reboxetine also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, but at a slower rate than that of norepinephrine. It may also have antidepressant and antianxiety effects.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RELENZA is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RELENZA is not known, but it is believed that it works by blocking the effects of a protein called SGLT2, which normally helps the kidney reabsorb glucose. When this protein is blocked, glucose reabsorption in the kidney is reduced, causing more glucose to be excreted in the urine. This action lowers the blood glucose level and decreases the glucose content of the urine.

In studies, RELENZA has been shown to be effective in reducing blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

SGLT2 inhibitors can cause some patients to become dehydrated. As a result, they may lose more body water than usual.

The exact rate of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) with SGLT2 inhibitors has not been fully studied.

Ribostamycin, however, has also been reported to be active against a variety of other microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, fungi, and protozoa.
The chemical structure of Ribostamycin is as follows: ##STR1##
Ribostamycin has been prepared in a number of different ways. In one approach, the biosynthesis of the antibiotic was investigated. Using radiolabelled precursors, it was determined that the antibiotic was formed from L-alanine, D-glyceric acid, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. However, no enzymatic activity was detected that catalyzed the conversion of L-alanine and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to ribostamycin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rifabutin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rifabutin is still unclear. It is known to inhibit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase by blocking the binding of deoxyribonucleotides to the enzyme, thus preventing DNA synthesis. The drug is bactericidal against M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo, and also inactivation of the enzyme is thought to be involved in its bactericidal activity.
Rifabutin is a secondary metabolite of some Streptomyces species, such as Rifabutin is produced by Streptomyces sp. No. MA19-2.543. The chemical structure of Rifabutin is a tetracyclic compound with a molecular weight of about 583.5 g/mol.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rifampin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rifampin is unknown. Rifampin is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, but does not affect the cell wall synthesis. The binding site of rifampin on bacterial RNA polymerase is different from that of beta-lactam antibiotics. It is possible that rifampin may act by blocking the path of the growing RNA chain, thus preventing the completion of the chain and inhibiting the transcription. It is also possible that rifampin interacts with a different site on the RNA polymerase and inhibits the elongation step.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RILUZOLE is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RILUZOLE is to inhibit the deacetylase activity of sirtuins and increase histone acetylation, resulting in the increased expression of FoxO1 and PPARα and decreased expression of FAS, PPARγ, and CPT1 ([@B5]).

The impact of the above-mentioned mechanism on the expression of PPARα and PPARγ in the liver was not measured in this study. However, it is important to note that the most important consequence of PPARα activation is the inhibition of FAS and CPT1, and that increased FAS activity is associated with the accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol ([@B13]). In addition, increased CPT1 activity decreases fat accumulation by increasing the β-oxidation of fatty acids ([@B11]). In this study, RILUZOLE increased the expression of FAS and CPT1.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RIMADYL is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RIMADYL is not fully understood. In the proposed mechanism, RIMADYL acts through a dual mechanism of action: a covalent adduct formation with intracellular thiols and inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which is responsible for the degradation of incretin hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide, GIP). This results in increased levels of active GLP-1 and GIP. In addition, RIMADYL increases insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.

RIMADYL is not approved in the United States.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rimonabant is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rimonabant is as follows: it is a selective, brain-penetrant CB1 antagonist, which reduces food intake, body weight, and fat mass in obese animals and humans. The anorectic effect of Rimonabant is due to activation of central 5-HT1A receptors, as well as to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and to the stimulation of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. These effects are likely to be mediated by the blockade of the endocannabinoid (EC) system in the brain, as demonstrated by the attenuation of the anorectic effect of Rimonabant by the blockade of EC transmission in the brain. In addition, Rimonabant exerts a positive effect on the metabolism of fatty acids, since it stimulates the β-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver, resulting in a reduction of the circulating free fatty acids.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ripretinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ripretinib is to target JAK2, a tyrosine kinase enzyme that is part of the Janus kinase family of intracellular signaling proteins. Inhibitors of JAK2 are designed to block this enzyme's kinase activity and thus, block the downstream signaling that is responsible for many of the effects of the cytokines and growth factors that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation. In this way, the JAK2 inhibitor is designed to be used as a cancer treatment and also as an anti-inflammatory agent.

The use of JAK2 inhibitors has been proven to be effective in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, is approved for the treatment of patients with PV

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rocuronium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rocuronium is believed to be similar to that of the other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. It is believed to produce neuromuscular block by binding to a peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and blocking the action of acetylcholine. The effect of Rocuronium is potentiated by tubocurarine and reversed by neostigmine. Rocuronium has a short onset of action and a rapid offset of action. The effect of Rocuronium is rapid and produces a very deep neuromuscular block. Rocuronium is a rapid acting and very long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a very rapid offset of action. Rocuronium produces a stable neuromuscular block of long duration. Rocuronium has been shown to be a relatively selective cholinesterase inhibitor.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rotenone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rotenone is to selectively inhibit the activity of Complex I, a key enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The inhibition of Complex I leads to an energy deficiency, which causes the ATP level to drop, the phosphorylation potential to decrease, and ultimately, to cell death. The most significant drawback of Rotenone is that it affects all mitochondria, and therefore all cells in the body, regardless of their specific energy needs.

The physiological effects of Rotenone are highly variable, and can include depression, irritability, agitation, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, confusion, vomiting, seizures, and coma.

The most common side effects of Rotenone include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The ERK pathway is activated in response to growth factors and other signals that activate the Ras GTPase, a membrane-bound protein that binds guanine nucleotides and becomes activated. The activated Ras protein then causes the sequential activation of Raf kinase, MEK, and ERK. When ERK is activated, it is phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine residues, and these phosphorylated residues function as docking sites for downstream targets. The ERK pathway plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In addition, the ERK pathway has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease and ischemia-induced cerebral infarction.
RRx-001 has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of stroke and ischemia, and is presently being evaluated in clinical trials

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of (R)-Serine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of (R)-Serine is illustrated in FIG. 1. It was shown that (R)-Serine (RS) is incorporated into the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is a key regulator of cellular function. RS is incorporated by the active site of PKA as a substrate, with subsequent phosphorylation of the Serine residue. RS is not used as a substrate for the inhibitory subunit of PKA (PKAI) and does not bind to PKAI.

(R)-Serine is used to treat patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who have been treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for over a year. (R)-Serine is the sole source of Serine in the human body and therefore is readily metabolized in the liver and kidney. As a result, (R)-Serine is readily cleared from the body, thereby limiting the risk of toxic

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RTA is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RTA is complex, but there is clear evidence that the diphtheria toxin A chain is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis.^[@ref1]^ In particular, RTA blocks the elongation step of translation by binding to ribosomes and inhibiting the formation of the ternary complex.^[@ref2]^ Recent studies have shown that the protein synthesis inhibitory activity of RTA can be separated into two distinct steps: (i) inhibition of the GTPase activity of eEF1A, which is essential for binding of the GTP-bound form of eEF1A to the A site of the ribosome, and (ii) inhibition of the peptidyltransferase activity of eEF2, which is essential for the elongation step of translation.^[@ref3]^

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rucaparib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rucaparib is through the inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity and DNA repair, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks and inhibition of the DNA damage repair process, and subsequently leading to apoptosis. PARP1 is an enzyme involved in the repair of single-strand DNA breaks. Rucaparib prevents PARP1 binding to single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, Rucaparib has been shown to inhibit the activity of other PARP enzymes in cells, and may potentially be used in the treatment of other PARP-associated diseases.

Rucaparib was approved by the FDA in December 2015 under the trade name Veliparib for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer who have received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy, as monotherapy, in combination with a platinum-based chemotherapy agent, or in combination

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rupatadine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rupatadine is unknown. Rupatadine is a non-sedating, non-systemic, anti-histamine. It has a broad anti-allergic spectrum, having a unique profile of action, with potent and selective inhibition of mediators released from mast cells. Rupatadine also inhibits leukotrienes and protects against antigen-induced bronchoconstriction. Rupatadine is a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist with anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity.

Adverse events are common, occurring in up to 50% of patients, but are usually mild to moderate in nature. Severe adverse events such as syncope and urticaria are very rare.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Rutin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Rutin is the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a protein kinase that functions as a fuel gauge, and that regulates cellular energy homeostasis.

The key finding of the study was that Rutin was more effective than exercise at increasing levels of AMPK in the liver and skeletal muscle. This resulted in the authors concluding that Rutin is a better exercise mimetic than exercise itself.

In fact, in the absence of exercise, Rutin increased AMPK activity in the liver and skeletal muscle to a greater extent than exercise itself.

In addition, the study showed that Rutin was more effective at increasing AMPK activity in the liver than in the skeletal muscle.

The authors suggest that the difference in effectiveness of Rutin between the liver and skeletal muscle may be due to differences in metabolic demand, which could be higher in the liver than in the skeletal muscle.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of RVX-208(RVX-000222) is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of RVX-208(RVX-000222) is an investigational new drug (IND)-enabling formulation of an RNAi therapeutic targeting the *Rb1* tumor suppressor gene. Rb1 is mutated in more than 50% of all human cancers, including lung, breast, and head and neck cancers.

Rb1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of E2F-responsive genes that are critical for cell cycle progression. Mutations in the *Rb1* gene, which encodes the Rb1 protein, lead to the loss of cell cycle regulation and uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells. Although the loss of Rb1 function occurs in most types of human cancer, it is of special significance in lung cancer, as more than 60% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have lost Rb1 expression ([@R1]).

Response: The mechanism of action of s1023 is unknown, although its primary effect appears to be induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It has been suggested that s1023 may induce apoptosis by the activation of the tumor suppressor gene p53. s1023 also activates a number of transcription factors including p53, c-jun, and c-fos. The induction of p53 may occur by the induction of an apoptotic stimulus and/or by the inhibition of the synthesis of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. In addition, s1023 has been shown to cause the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1, suggesting that the induction of these inhibitors may be another mechanism by which s1023 exerts its effects. s1023 has also been shown to increase the levels of c-myc mRNA and protein. s10

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S2597-Oseltamivir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S2597-Oseltamivir is as follows. The virus is inactivated by the viral neuraminidase, NA, which is a type of enzyme. The active site of the NA is called the sialic acid binding pocket. This pocket is a deep and narrow cavity, and its binding pocket size is different for each NA type. Thus, it is possible to select a compound that selectively binds to a specific NA type. The NA-specific inhibitor S2597-Oseltamivir is an example of a NA-specific inhibitor. The active sialic acid binding pocket of NA is called the sialic acid binding pocket.

In general, NA inhibitors are categorized as follows.    (1) The first category includes NA inhibitors that directly bind to the sialic acid binding pocket of NA. The sialic acid binding pocket is the active site of NA.    (2) The

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3003 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3003 is based on the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of thymidylate synthase (TS) ([Figure 1](#ijms-19-00139-f001){ref-type="fig"}). TS is a key enzyme in DNA biosynthesis, and its inhibition can lead to the arrest of cell proliferation. TS is located in the mitochondria and has a two-domain structure, with a non-heme iron atom in the active site of the N-terminal domain and a glutathione thiyl radical in the active site of the C-terminal domain. The active site of the enzyme is protected by a redox-active cysteine residue in the C-terminal domain. The thiyl radical is reduced by the cysteine residue of the active site, and then the active site is regenerated \[[@B25-ijms-19-00139]\]. S300

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3074 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3074 is based on the high levels of endothelial cell proliferation and the anti-angiogenic effect of this compound. In fact, S3074 inhibits the migration and tube formation of human endothelial cells. In vivo studies on zebrafish and mouse embryos showed that S3074 decreases endothelial cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis.

Because of the complex mechanism of action of S3074, it is likely that it can have both beneficial and adverse effects. The adverse effects of this drug include the fact that it causes severe thrombocytopenia and bone marrow toxicity. Moreover, a recent study found that S3074 treatment induces DNA damage in cells of the gastrointestinal tract \[[@B16-ijms-21-00662]\]. It was also shown that S3074 may be useful in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors \[[@B15-ijms-21-00662]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3120 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3120 is not fully understood. It is known to increase the expression of glucose transporters, as well as to increase the expression of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, which are closed when the cell is not under metabolic stress. This leads to a decrease in intracellular ATP, which causes a reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis \[[@B14-ijms-21-00951]\].

The combination of S3120 and gemcitabine was more effective than gemcitabine alone in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell growth. The mechanism of this synergism may be related to the induction of apoptosis by gemcitabine and inhibition of DNA synthesis by S3120. However, this is not the only mechanism of action of the combination of gemcitabine and S3120, because S3120 also inhibits the expression of glucose transporters and induces the expression of K

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3605 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3605 is through inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4D, a type of phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to its inactive form, AMP. The inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis results in increased intracellular cAMP levels and thus activates the protein kinase A pathway. The protein kinase A pathway has been shown to be a major mediator of the cellular effects of S3605 in a variety of tissues and cell types.

S3605 is a selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), a member of the family of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) specific phosphodiesterases.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3606 is unknown, but it has been shown to inhibit NOS in brain tissue from animals, suggesting that it could be acting by a similar mechanism. We have shown that S3606 decreases the duration of the tonic component of the acoustic startle response (ASR) in rats (see Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}), an effect consistent with a decrease in the excitability of neurons in the central auditory pathway. The ASR is a complex response that can be broken down into a phasic and a tonic component (Kalume et al. [@CR19]; Malatesta et al. [@CR27]). The phasic component is the response to a brief (100--200 ms) acoustic stimulus, while the tonic component is the increase in ASR that occurs in the presence of continuous (\>200 ms) stimulation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3611 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3611 is not completely understood. It has been postulated that S3611 works by blocking the LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway. In the presence of S3611, TLR4 is unable to bind to LPS, preventing the initiation of the TLR4 signaling cascade and resulting in decreased cytokine production \[[@B38-toxins-09-00252]\]. However, there are no published reports on the effects of S3611 on TLR4 signaling, and it is not yet clear if S3611 directly binds to TLR4 or is simply preventing the interaction of LPS and TLR4.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3621 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3621 is still not clear. One possible mechanism is that S3621 interferes with the phosphorylation of a key protein kinase. Our study has shown that S3621 downregulates the phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In addition, the effect of S3621 on Akt phosphorylation can be reversed by LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K. These results indicate that S3621 may exert its antitumor effect by interfering with the phosphorylation of Akt.

Another possible mechanism is that S3621 may inhibit the transcription of some genes involved in cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 are tumor suppressors that inhibit cell cycle progression. p21 is a downstream target of p53, and its expression

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3622 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3622 is unclear and may involve, but is not limited to, the inhibition of one or more of the following: (1) inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and/or (2) deoxycytidine kinase (dCK).

Although dTTP is required for the synthesis of DNA, high dTTP levels have been shown to have deleterious effects in tumor cells.

In tumor cells, dTTP can be deaminated by dUTPases to dUTP, which can then be incorporated into DNA. In normal cells, dUTP is not produced and dTTP is used for the synthesis of DNA.

Inhibition of IMPDH results in the accumulation of the downstream metabolites guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and inosine monophosphate (IMP), which inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis, respectively.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3625 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3625 is different from that of nifedipine, a well-known Ca^2+^ channel blocker. S3625 did not block Ca^2+^ influx into the cells. The S3625-induced relaxation was unaffected by a decrease in extracellular Ca^2+^ concentration from 1.8 mM to 0.1 mM. In addition, a blocker of Ca^2+^-activated K^+^ channels, charybdotoxin, did not inhibit the S3625-induced relaxation. These findings suggest that the relaxation of the pulmonary artery induced by S3625 is not mediated by Ca^2+^-activated K^+^ channels. In addition, the relaxation induced by S3625 was unaffected by treatment with glibenclamide or apamin, two K~ATP~ channel inhibitors.

Because Ca^2+^-activated K^+^ channels are known to be

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3636 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3636 is poorly understood. The S3636-induced death of colon cancer cells is likely mediated by the induction of autophagy. However, we cannot exclude that apoptosis is involved in the S3636-induced death of colon cancer cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of apoptosis in S3636-induced cell death.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3637 is unknown, but the cytotoxicity of S3637 may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis and/or the inhibition of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Further study is needed to clarify the precise mechanism of action of S3637.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3638 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3638 is currently unknown. It is not clear whether S3638 causes the death of CLL cells through an apoptosis-independent pathway or through an apoptosis-dependent pathway.

In conclusion, S3638 is a novel and promising agent for the treatment of CLL. Our results indicate that S3638 has a strong cytotoxic effect against CLL cells, induces apoptosis and leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes. The mechanism of action of S3638 involves the inhibition of HDAC6, and the down-regulation of the Akt-mTOR-p70S6K signaling pathway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3639 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3639 is as follows. The action of the agent is based on its binding to the nAChR and the subsequent desensitization of the receptor. The resulting desensitization leads to a decrease in the number of channels that are available for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The inhibition of the nAChR by S3639 results in a lower release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which may explain the observed effects of S3639 on various symptoms of AD.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3640 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3640 is a matter of debate. Several lines of evidence suggest that S3640 may act by disrupting the cholesterol-dependent anchoring of a protein to the plasma membrane and therefore has a role in lipid raft formation \[[@CR19]\]. Alternatively, S3640 may be able to interact with sterols, leading to the accumulation of a cytotoxic, misfolded protein. Indeed, it has been reported that S3640 can induce apoptosis of *P. falciparum*-infected erythrocytes by acting on cholesterol metabolism \[[@CR17]\]. In contrast, others have proposed that S3640 may induce a proteasome-dependent degradation of a protein \[[@CR20]\].

The development of resistance is a serious concern for the use of S3640 in malaria therapy. To date, no evidence of drug resistance has been reported in *P. falcip

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3641 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3641 is not completely clear. However, it has been shown to be effective in vivo and in vitro. The data suggest that the antitumor activity of S3641 is associated with the selective activation of p53 and downregulation of MDM2. The increase in p53 level is thought to cause the induction of apoptosis. The inhibition of MDM2 has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. This arrest could be either p53-dependent or p53-independent.

In vivo studies

In vivo studies have shown that S3641 is active in mice bearing human tumour xenografts. In the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model, S3641 showed antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, with a complete response in one mouse. The combination of S3641 and radiation was also effective.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3642 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3642 is thought to be due to inhibition of the β~2~-adrenergic receptor, which results in a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequent reduction of PKA activity.^[@bib1]^ The inhibition of the β~2~-adrenergic receptor is achieved through a combination of the ability of the S3642 molecule to fit into the orthosteric binding site of the receptor and the formation of a covalent bond with Cys265, which is a conserved cysteine residue in the orthosteric binding site.^[@bib2]^

The study of the human β~2~-adrenergic receptor has been the subject of much interest, particularly due to the wide array of diseases that are associated with the dysregulation of the receptor. The pharmacological properties of S3642 have been studied in multiple *in vitro*

Response: The mechanism of action of S3643 is unknown. Although there is no currently available data regarding the in vivo efficacy of S3643, our in vitro data show that S3643 is effective in a variety of cancer cell lines. In vivo studies of S3643 are currently being conducted in collaboration with Project 2 of this Center Grant application. In addition, S3643 is currently being tested in a Phase I trial of patients with advanced solid tumors. In vitro data show that S3643 is effective against cells with mutations in the PTEN gene. The proposed project will study the effect of S3643 on the cells with mutations in PTEN. The results of the proposed studies will provide the necessary information for determining whether S3643 can be used to treat PTEN deficient tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3645 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3645 is still unknown. The result of the present study revealed that S3645 inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, as well as that of prostate cancer stem cells, suggesting that the anti-proliferative activity of S3645 is not restricted to cancer cells but is also exerted on cancer stem cells. This may explain the high curative rate of patients with prostate cancer who have undergone castration therapy with S3645.

The present study demonstrated that S3645 inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer stem cells, and this was also demonstrated in vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated that castration inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vivo [@pone.0074167-Raborn1], [@pone.0074167-Hohenberger1]. Moreover, we have demonstrated that S3645 inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro [@pone.0074167-Sato1].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3646 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3646 is thought to be mediated by binding to the α1β2 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and subsequently inhibiting its trafficking to the cell membrane, and therefore reducing NMDAR activity. S3646 is under development by Novartis for the treatment of pain, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain.

S3646 was granted orphan drug status in the United States in November 2010.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3647 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3647 is the combination of the immune activating properties of antibodies and the anti-inflammatory properties of antagonists of the TNF receptor family. TNF-α has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart failure, bone resorption disorders and other conditions and diseases in the human and animal. See generally, Georges et al. (1994) J. Clin. Invest. 94:1473-1483. TNF-α also plays a role in the area of immune response. See generally, Salomon et al. (1991) Curr. Opin. Immunol. 3:284-288.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3649 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3649 is expected to be similar to that of other second-generation P2Y12 inhibitors, as the pharmacokinetic properties of S3649 are similar to those of the other approved second-generation P2Y12 inhibitors.

The safety and efficacy of S3649 was evaluated in a dose-escalation phase 1 trial (NCT00374971) and a phase 2b trial (NCT00790029) in healthy volunteers. S3649 was well tolerated in both trials, and the most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and vomiting. All of these events were mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence was dose-related. No subjects had any bleeding or thrombotic events.[@b10-dddt-8-1221]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3650 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3650 is similar to other purine nucleoside analogs in the family of adenosine analogs. However, unlike the others, S3650 can be phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, a key enzyme in the salvage pathway, to form a triphosphate. This provides an advantage over other purine nucleoside analogs, as it has a much higher intracellular concentration and is more readily incorporated into DNA. This increases the number of lesions formed and therefore increases the antitumor activity. This action is highly selective for tumor cells. S3650 also has an important pharmacological advantage over other adenosine analogs. S3650 is an antagonist of A1 and A3 adenosine receptors. The A1 receptor is expressed on almost all cell types, while the A3 receptor is highly expressed on the surface of most human tumors. In contrast, the A2A receptor is expressed on neutrophils

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3656 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3656 is unique in that it inhibits both the PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk pathways. It has a unique profile of activity against different cell lines, where in the range of 5 to 10 *μ*M, it is highly cytotoxic against melanoma and ovarian cancer cells, but has a lower potency against other cancer cell lines such as colon cancer cells, suggesting that the cytotoxic activity of S3656 is not universal across different cancer types. The compound has been shown to be cytotoxic against melanoma cells and not against other cancer cells, indicating that it may have a role in the treatment of melanoma. However, as a monotherapy, it is not as potent as a MEK inhibitor. The activity of S3656 has been shown to be superior to a combination of the two drugs in melanoma cells, with synergistic activity when used in combination with the MEK inhibitor. The findings in

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3657 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3657 is not well understood, although some indirect evidence suggests that it may act by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. In an in vitro model of inflammation, S3657 inhibited the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. S3657 also inhibited the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI). S3657 also inhibited the production of MIP-2 in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S3657, and to determine the dose of S3657 that can be administered to healthy volunteers and patients.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3658 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3658 is to inhibit the expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in tumor cells, leading to reduced tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.[@b39-dddt-10-163] Preclinical studies in tumor models demonstrated that S3658 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis.[@b40-dddt-10-163] In a Phase I study, patients with advanced solid tumors were administered S3658 (3--8 mg/kg) for 21 days every 4 weeks. A total of 41 patients were treated. The most common toxicities were grade 1/2 fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. One patient had grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 abdominal pain, which were both controlled with supportive care. Three patients had a partial response, two patients had stable disease, and three patients had progressive disease.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3659 is being developed by Syneos Health. S3659 is in Phase II clinical trials for multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer, and solid tumors.

S3659 has been tested in combination with dasatinib in multiple myeloma, showing additive activity in cell-based assays.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3662 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3662 is based on the assumption that it binds to an inactive conformation of human neutrophil elastase (HNE), and that the HNE conformation which binds to S3662 is in an autoinhibited state. This can be achieved by blocking the active site of HNE or by inducing a conformational change in HNE. This latter mechanism has been previously shown for other HNE inhibitors such as the peptidyl nitrone-hydroxylamine class of inhibitors \[[@B15-molecules-21-01088]\].

The inhibitory potency of S3662 in the displacement of the fluorescent inhibitor Dnp-Pro-Arg-β-naphthylamide (Dnp-PRONA) is similar to that of aprotinin, a well-known competitive inhibitor of HNE ([Table 1](#molecules-21-01088-t001){ref-type

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3663 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3663 is the induction of protein ubiquitination. This is not unexpected given that many anti-cancer drugs induce protein ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of oncoproteins, and S3663 was designed to mimic this activity. S3663 can induce degradation of both the oncoproteins, EGFR and HER2, as well as of the constitutively active mutant form of the AKT oncoprotein.

To further investigate the mechanism of action of S3663, we performed a phospho-proteomic analysis of human colon cancer cells treated with S3663. This revealed that S3663 induces phosphorylation of AKT at multiple sites, including S473 and T308. Interestingly, these two sites are well known to be sites of AKT phosphorylation induced by growth factors \[[@B35-molecules-22-01159]\]. Thus, S3663 may mimic

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3664 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3664 is complex and involves inhibition of the Hsp90 ATPase, Hsp70 and Hsp40, as well as ubiquitin ligase activity, and interaction with the proteasome and polyubiquitinated proteins. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that maintains the conformational stability of its client proteins and prevents the formation of non-functional aggregates \[[@B52-ijms-20-00240],[@B53-ijms-20-00240],[@B54-ijms-20-00240]\]. S3664 can bind to the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, which results in inhibition of ATPase activity, as well as disruption of the Hsp90-client protein complex \[[@B55-ijms-20-00240]\]. Hsp90 is essential for the stability and function of many oncogenic proteins, including Akt, RAF1

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3666 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3666 is to act as a "smart" anti-angiogenic drug, selectively inhibiting endothelial cells and not cancer cells, in a similar manner to drugs such as VEGF inhibitors. It is a small molecule (molecular weight 623) which binds directly to the VEGF receptor and does not require the receptor for dimerisation and activation.

It has been found that S3666 inhibits the formation of the endothelial cell tube-like structures in an in vitro angiogenesis assay, by disrupting the function of VEGFR2.

As a result of this mechanism of action, S3666 was found to have in vivo anti-angiogenic activity in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. S3666 was also found to be well tolerated and efficacious in a dose-escalation study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3667 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3667 is unknown. It has been speculated that the drug acts as a polyamine transport inhibitor \[[@B5-pharmaceuticals-09-00054]\]. However, in vitro studies using human cancer cell lines did not show any correlation between intracellular polyamine levels and the antiproliferative effect of S3667 \[[@B6-pharmaceuticals-09-00054]\]. Moreover, our studies with yeast *ppp3* mutants revealed that the drug is not a polyamine transport inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that the antiproliferative effect of S3667 may be related to inhibition of arginine metabolism. In this study, we showed that S3667 inhibited the activity of PIM1, which is a mitochondrial enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of ornithine to citrulline. The production of citrulline is a key step in the conversion of argin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3668 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3668 is mediated through the induction of a cytotoxic cascade involving TNF-α-dependent apoptosis and, most importantly, p38 MAPK activation, which leads to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase.^[@bib30]^ The mechanism of action of SB203580 is less well understood. However, this agent has been reported to inhibit the release of TNF-α and NF-κB activation, which in turn results in decreased TNF-α production.^[@bib31]^

There are several notable limitations of the current study. First, although this was a randomized, double-blind, phase II trial, it was not placebo controlled, and thus a causal relationship between S3668 treatment and clinical benefit cannot be definitively established. However, this study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of S3668, and the p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest observed in

In addition to S3669, Sunesis also has other promising drugs in development including S1420, which is an inhibitor of the production of type I interferons, and S2156, which is an inhibitor of both interferon alpha and beta receptors. The Company is currently in the pre-clinical stage of development of S1420 and S2156.

Sunesis’ proprietary drug discovery platform has led to the identification of S3669, a novel inhibitor of the interferon alpha receptor. The Company has been developing S3669 since 2009 and has already demonstrated the compound’s potential to be a new class of drug for the treatment of chronic viral infections, particularly in patients infected with hepatitis C virus. S3669 is a first-in-class drug that may offer patients an effective new treatment for hepatitis C and other chronic viral infections.

The NS5B polymerase is a major target for the treatment of HCV. The most successful class of NS5B polymerase inhibitors is the 2′-*C*-methyl nucleoside analogues.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3672 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3672 is a complex process. S3672 inhibits Cdc42 and Rac, but it is unclear whether it acts as a direct inhibitor of these GTPases or if it indirectly acts through other proteins. The effects of S3672 are dose-dependent, and increasing doses of S3672 inhibit proliferation and migration of cancer cells, although the doses required for these effects are higher than the IC~50~ values for the inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac. This suggests that S3672 acts by inhibiting Cdc42 and Rac at higher doses, and that other proteins are involved at lower doses.

We have shown that S3672 has a higher affinity for Cdc42 than Rac. These results suggest that S3672 has a higher affinity for Cdc42 than Rac and that this could be the mechanism of action of S3672. It has been reported that S3672 inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, although the mechanism is not

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3673 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3673 is different from that of taxanes, which stabilize microtubules by binding to the beta-tubulin subunit. S3673 stabilizes microtubules by preventing their depolymerization. S3673 inhibits tubulin polymerization and stabilizes microtubules. The maximum effect of S3673 was achieved at concentrations greater than 20 microM. S3673 is highly specific for microtubules, as it has little effect on the depolymerization of actin filaments.

S3673 has been evaluated in a number of phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies.  A total of 42 patients with advanced solid tumors have been enrolled in the phase I clinical trials.  S3673 has demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity.  It was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/m2.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3674 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3674 is currently under investigation. However, our data indicate that it inhibits Cdc20 binding to Cdc20-APC, as well as Cdc20-APC complex formation. In addition, we show that S3674 is also a potent inhibitor of the G1-S transition in tumor cells, and inhibits the growth of several tumor cell lines in vivo. Our data demonstrate that S3674 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis in tumor cells by blocking the binding of Cdc20 to Cdc20-APC, and suggest that S3674 may be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of human tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3681 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3681 is to inhibit Rho kinase (ROCK), which is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and is a downstream effector of Rho GTPases, which regulate a variety of cellular functions including cell shape, adhesion, motility, and proliferation. ROCK regulates these cellular functions by phosphorylating downstream targets, including myosin light chain (MLC), which is the principle substrate for ROCK.
MLC is a major target of ROCK and is regulated by phosphorylation at a single threonine residue (Thr18/Ser19) in its C-terminal region. MLC phosphorylation is regulated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) which dephosphorylates MLC in response to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3684 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3684 is currently unknown, however the lack of sequence similarity between S3684 and known p38 inhibitors suggests that it is unlikely to act by inhibiting p38 directly.

In addition to S3684, a number of other potent, ATP-competitive p38 inhibitors have been reported. These include GSK229316, JNKI-1, SB203580, BIRB-796, VX-745 and PNU-37883A. The primary structural differences between these compounds are at the C-4 position of the quinazolinone ring, which may allow them to occupy different regions of the p38 ATP-binding site. The crystal structure of p38 in complex with GSK229316 has been reported, but unfortunately the compound is not a particularly good inhibitor.

In a series of six patients with hypercholesterolemia and low LDL-C levels, there was no effect on total cholesterol or triglycerides \[[@B25]\]. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, there was a reduction in LDL-C levels.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3690 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3690 is thought to be through the inhibition of nuclear export of STAT1 and STAT3, and to be selective for the nuclear localization of these proteins. It also inhibits the ability of these proteins to bind to their response elements and to activate transcription. This results in inhibition of interferon-induced gene expression, which is important in host defenses against viral infection and cancer. S3690 is a pyridylmethylsulfone, and is structurally related to the sulfones previously disclosed as STAT1 inhibitors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3692 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3692 is believed to be similar to that of the anthracycline doxorubicin. Both drugs cause topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage. S3692 has been shown to inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types in preclinical studies. In Phase I clinical trials, S3692 was shown to be active against a variety of tumor types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon cancer, gastric cancer, and sarcomas.

Preliminary safety data from a Phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors indicated that S3692 was generally well tolerated at doses ranging from 5 to 40 mg/m2.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3694 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3694 is similar to the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, which induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the cytosol and nucleus ([@bib30]). Although the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is not the only pathway for protein degradation, this pathway plays a key role in the degradation of short-lived proteins, including IκBα, p27, p53, and Bim ([@bib30]).

We examined the effects of S3694 on the degradation of IκBα and the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB in THP-1 cells. Treatment with S3694 induced a marked decrease in IκBα protein level and a slight decrease in p65 protein level. In contrast, the levels of p50, p52, and RelB remained unchanged ([Fig. 2 A](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}). To examine whether S3694

Response: The mechanism of action of S3697 is currently unknown. In this study, the growth of ES-2 ovarian cancer cells was inhibited by S3697 in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of ES-2 cells was inhibited by S3697 in a dose-dependent manner. S3697 induced apoptosis of ES-2 cells, as determined by the increase in the number of Annexin V-positive cells and cleavage of PARP. The caspase-3/7 activity was significantly increased by S3697. The levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were changed by S3697 treatment. S3697 increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, suggesting that S3697 induces apoptosis by increasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. In conclusion, S3697 induces apoptosis in ES-2

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3698 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3698 is unknown. Although S3698 is a well tolerated compound, its activity is limited by its low solubility in water. The solubility of S3698 was enhanced by the formation of a solid dispersion formulation, which was achieved by a high-pressure homogenization process. The resultant solid dispersion formulation was stable for at least 6 months. When administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg twice a day for 4 days, S3698 exhibited a good pharmacokinetic profile and inhibited VEGF-induced vascular permeability in a mouse skin inflammation model. The combination of S3698 with liposomal doxorubicin exhibited synergistic anti-tumor activity against a mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer. S3698 is a novel and potent inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3701 is through inhibition of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 and thereby affects their ability to recruit their effectors to the cell membrane. S3701 causes cell rounding and causes F-actin to accumulate in the cell membrane and actin bundles. Additionally, S3701 causes a loss of the cell-cell contacts and a loss of adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in both 2D and 3D cell cultures \[[@B18-ijms-21-05485]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S3703 is unique in that it is a non-specific MMP inhibitor. The structure of S3703 was optimized to have broad specificity for MMPs and minimal off-target effects, in order to improve its therapeutic index. This is in contrast to other MMP inhibitors, which are designed to target only one or a few specific MMPs, which can be very effective, but have the risk of causing significant side effects, since many different MMPs are expressed in normal tissues. The results of a Phase 1 study of S3703 have been published. S3703 was well tolerated in this study, and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. In a Phase 2 study of S3703 in patients with metastatic cancer, an overall response rate of 24% was observed.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3705 is unknown, but it is not an inhibitor of the arylamine N-acetyltransferase enzyme. S3705 is being developed by Chiron Corporation for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

History

S3705 was discovered by Novartis and Chiron Corporation and is under development by Chiron Corporation for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. It is a piperazine derivative that was identified in a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) program that was conducted at Novartis.

In February 2009, Chiron Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted for filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for S3705. Chiron also announced that the FDA had accepted a Biologics License Application (BLA) for S3705 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In March 2009, Chiron announced that the FDA had approved S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3706 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3706 is not well understood. One possibility is that it inhibits CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, or other chemokine receptors. Another possibility is that S3706 binds to the chemokine binding site of CXCR4, which is the domain of CXCR4 that binds to CXCL12. Binding to the chemokine binding site would interfere with the interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4 and prevent the signaling cascade that results from CXCL12 binding to CXCR4. The signaling cascade that results from CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 includes: phosphorylation of the receptor, G-protein activation, phospholipase C activation, Ca2+ mobilization, MAP kinase activation, and stimulation of the cell cycle. These events are associated with a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, chemotaxis, and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3707 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3707 is a unique combination of cell killing activity and inhibition of proliferation. The S3707 killing activity has been shown to be related to the induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation has been shown to be related to the activation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein, Cdc25A, by S3707. Cdc25A is a phosphatase that activates the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that are essential for cell cycle progression. Cdc25A is activated by phosphorylation and inactivated by dephosphorylation.

The results of the phase I trial demonstrated that S3707 was well tolerated in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg/m^2^/day for 4 days, and there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values. A total of 16 patients were treated in the phase I trial, and dose escalation was not required. The results showed that the maximal tolerated dose (MT

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3711 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3711 is still under investigation, but its effect on the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells suggests a possible role for the inhibition of the androgen receptor. The in vivo activity of S3711 was assessed in a panel of tumor models. S3711 exhibited potent antitumor activity in both xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of prostate cancer, demonstrating activity across a broad range of both androgen-dependent and -independent tumors. S3711 showed high efficacy in the presence of enzalutamide, a clinically relevant antiandrogen, and exhibited synergistic activity with enzalutamide in a mouse xenograft model. In vitro, S3711 showed little activity against a panel of normal human cells, but was able to selectively inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. These findings suggest that S3711 is a promising candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3713 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3713 is not fully understood. However, the presence of S3713 on the surface of live cells suggests that S3713 may exert its antiviral activity through direct cell surface interactions. It is also possible that the observed antiviral effect is due to the presence of S3713 on the surface of cells that have undergone virus infection. For example, it has been shown that S3713 has a modest effect on HSV-1 attachment to cells, which could account for its antiviral activity ([@B8]). The fact that the antiviral effect of S3713 is only modest suggests that other mechanisms of action are likely involved. For example, the inhibitory effect of S3713 on the infectivity of FHV-1 could be due to its interference with FHV-1 replication or its induction of the antiviral state. In addition, the observation that S3713 did not significantly affect the attachment of FHV-1 to

The protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8220 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A block the ability of S3714 to inhibit protein synthesis. In contrast, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, does not inhibit the ability of S3714 to inhibit protein synthesis. The results of these studies suggest that S3714 inhibits protein synthesis by a different mechanism than the protein kinase C inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3719 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3719 is complex and involves an indirect effect on mitochondria by modulating the activity of GSK-3β. This enzyme plays a key role in the Wnt signaling pathway and has a negative effect on beta-catenin \[[@B29-molecules-25-00772]\]. Our results indicate that the high level of activity of GSK-3β could be the cause of the increase in the level of beta-catenin in the nucleus and consequently, the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the treatment with S3719 caused an increase in the level of phosphorylated beta-catenin, suggesting that the increase in beta-catenin level was due to the inhibition of GSK-3β. The activity of GSK-3β is dependent on the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) \

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3720 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3720 is based on its ability to bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6. Inhibition of CDK4/6 prevents the phosphorylation of Rb and leads to the inhibition of E2F-dependent transcription. The inhibition of E2F-dependent transcription causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which ultimately results in cell death.[@b15-ott-9-3603] It is interesting to note that S3720 has shown antitumor activity against colon cancer in xenograft mouse models, including an in vivo study of S3720 in combination with irinotecan. In this study, the combination of S3720 and irinotecan significantly increased the inhibition of tumor growth in colon cancer xenografts compared with irinotecan or S3720 alone.

A range of different mechanisms have been proposed, including the disruption of the plasma membrane, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of glycolysis.^[@bib6]^ In the current study, the mechanism of action of S3722 was investigated.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3723 is not fully understood, but the results of this study suggest that it might be a result of multiple factors, including inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and apoptosis induction.

Conclusion
==========

S3723 was found to be a potent inhibitor of PDAC cell growth and was more potent than gemcitabine. Its anti-tumor activity was enhanced when combined with gemcitabine, and this combination was well tolerated in a mouse model of PDAC. The results of this study suggest that S3723 might be a novel treatment option for patients with PDAC.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3726 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3726 is similar to that of mTOR inhibitors. mTOR is an essential downstream regulator of AKT. Inhibition of AKT by S3726 leads to inhibition of mTOR. The exact mechanism of action of S3726 is not yet clear and needs further investigation.

The ability of S3726 to inhibit HNSCC cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The effect of S3726 on the growth of HNSCC cells was studied at various concentrations of S3726 (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μM). S3726 inhibited the proliferation of FaDu and Cal-33 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A similar result was also observed in FaDu and Cal-33 cells treated with AZD2014 (an mTOR

Response: The mechanism of action of S3727 is still unclear. This is because the number of molecules of S3727 is very small, and because S3727 can affect multiple molecules.

Conclusions {#Sec13}
===========

We have demonstrated that S3727 is a new compound that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of leukemia cells by inducing caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. S3727 may be a potential agent for the treatment of AML and its use as a sensitizer of cytotoxic drugs warrants further investigation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3728 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3728 is based on the pharmacological modulation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K~ATP~ channels), which can be pharmacologically activated by sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas have been shown to reduce ischemic stroke by the inhibition of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the neuronal membrane and the reduction of the infarct size.^[@bib1]^

The K~ATP~ channels are a family of potassium channels, which are located on the plasma membrane and are activated by the binding of ATP to their pore-forming subunits.^[@bib2]^ K~ATP~ channels are activated in response to low concentrations of intracellular ATP, resulting in the opening of the channel pore, which allows the passage of potassium ions, thereby hyperpolarizing the membrane potential.^[@bib3]^ The K~ATP~ channels are composed

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3735 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3735 is based on a selective inhibition of VEGFR-2, a member of the VEGF receptor family.

Chemistry

Structure and composition
S3735 is a peptide composed of amino acids with the general formula H2N-R-Cys-A2-A3-A4-A5-A6-COOH, where R is an amino acid side chain. It is a cyclic pentapeptide containing an N-terminal cysteine, two aromatic residues, and a carboxyl-terminal acid. S3735 contains four D-amino acids and one L-amino acid.

Pharmacology
S3735 is a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-2. The mechanism of action of S3735 is based on a selective inhibition of VEGFR-2.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3737 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3737 is still not fully understood. A recent study reported that it was an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B, but S3737 showed poor selectivity between MAO A and MAO B ([@bib21]). MAO A is the major MAO isoform expressed in the human brain ([@bib5]), and plays a role in the degradation of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine ([@bib6]). A previous study reported that MAO A inhibition increased the brain levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in rats ([@bib4]). A decrease in the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain may be related to the antidepressant effect of S3737. In addition, MAO A inhibitors have been reported to have anxiolytic and antidepressant effects ([@bib23]).

Furthermore, MAO A is known to regulate the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3738 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3738 is not fully understood. However, several mechanisms are believed to be involved. For example, one study showed that S3738 induces a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst that may activate cell death pathways ([@b17-ijo-48-06-2277]). S3738 is also reported to have direct cytotoxic activity, including induction of DNA damage and DNA double-strand breaks ([@b18-ijo-48-06-2277],[@b19-ijo-48-06-2277]). Furthermore, S3738 was shown to inhibit cell cycle progression and to cause apoptosis ([@b20-ijo-48-06-2277]).

Recent evidence has shown that DNA damage can induce autophagy, a process that plays an important role in the cellular response to various stressors, including anticancer drugs ([@b21-ijo-48-06-2277

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3739 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3739 is not well understood, although a primary mechanism of action is the ability of S3739 to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Other possible mechanisms include direct inhibition of tyrosine kinases, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), and/or inhibition of cellular proliferation.

##### Pharmacokinetics

Following IV administration, S3739 has a half-life of approximately 8 hours and is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. The drug is eliminated primarily in the urine as inactive metabolites. S3739 is generally well tolerated.

##### Adverse Effects

The most common adverse effects are fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, insomnia, and hypertension. Other less common adverse effects include increased hepatic enzymes, edema, vomiting, and increased serum creatinine.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3741 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3741 is unique. It is believed to work in a way that it causes damage to the DNA of the cancerous cells, thereby killing them. S3741 may also prevent the formation of new cancer cells and block their growth.

There are many ways in which you can take S3741. Some of the most common methods include:

Using the prescribed dosage

Taking the capsule form of the drug

Taking the pill form of the drug

The prescribed dosage for S3741 is 400mg per day. This is usually taken as two capsules twice a day. If you are on a low-calorie diet, you can also take the pill form of the drug.

S3741 side effects

Response: The mechanism of action of S3742 is a reduction in the transcription of TNFα and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. S3742 inhibits NF-κB binding to DNA and the TNFα gene promoter, while increasing the activity of the negative regulatory IκBα and promoting its degradation. In vivo S3742 also inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFα secretion in a mouse model of sepsis. These results suggest that S3742 is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3745 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3745 is poorly understood. Although it does not affect caspase-8, it does cause a sustained caspase-3 activation, as measured by the cleavage of the DEVD-pNA substrate. S3745 can cause apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, including Jurkat, U937, and HL60 cells, with EC50 values in the micromolar range. S3745-induced apoptosis can be completely blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor. A p53-independent pathway for S3745-induced apoptosis has been identified. The action of S3745 is unique in that it does not affect the activities of PARP-1, caspase-2, or caspase-7. S3745 does not bind to DNA and does not affect the activities of DNA topoisomerases I or II. S3745 causes a sustained increase in the level of intracellular reactive

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3746 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3746 is not fully understood. However, it is possible that the action is mediated by phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of the channel. The carboxyl terminus of the hERG channel contains a regulatory domain that interacts with the inner pore of the channel. The carboxyl terminus is involved in the formation of the inactivated state of the channel. A direct interaction of S3746 with the carboxyl terminus has been proposed to induce the inactivation of the channel, which results in the suppression of hERG current ([@b19-bt-23-301]).

In addition, the carboxyl terminus of the hERG channel contains a proline-rich domain, which is a known binding site for calmodulin. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein and is known to regulate the channel function ([@b7-bt-23-301]). Therefore, it is possible that the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3747 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3747 is believed to be through the inhibition of the binding of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) to cyclin E (CDK2 is a key regulator of the cell cycle). The accumulation of CDK2 with its cyclin partners, which are involved in the cell cycle, inhibits cell cycle progression.

Approvals and indications
On May 20, 2010, the FDA approved S3747 (as Elisidepsin) for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous or subcutaneous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with docetaxel.

In August 2013, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for S3747 for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous or subcutaneous NSCLC.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3749 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3749 is as a specific, non-competitive, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) to ZMP. S3749 is converted to its monophosphate (ZMP) by the action of the enzyme. ZMP is phosphorylated to its monophosphate form, AMP, by an adenosine kinase-like enzyme. Inhibition of the enzyme with S3749 does not inhibit the formation of AMP from ZMP, but does prevent the formation of ZMP from AICAR. This action leads to the accumulation of AICAR, and this compound is believed to be the intracellular analog of ZMP. The AICAR/ZMP pathway is important in regulating the metabolic activity of cells.

Animal toxicology and safety 
S3750 was tested in a range of animal models including rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and non-human primate. It was found to be safe in these animal models. The safety of S3750 was demonstrated in a 90-day dog study in which S3750 was administered at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. In this study, no clinical observations, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or histopathological observations were found to be significantly different from vehicle control.

In a rat repeat dose oral toxicity study, S3750 was administered at doses of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3751 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3751 is not fully understood, but the lack of immunogenicity may be due to the small size of the drug molecule and the absence of a protein sequence that would activate T-cells, or by the low-level expression of S3751 in tumor cells. The MHC-independent mechanism of action of S3751, which is similar to that of other immunotoxins, may contribute to its lack of immunogenicity \[[@B38]\].

S3751 was shown to have antitumor activity in a murine tumor model. Treatment with S3751 produced significant tumor growth inhibition in vivo in tumor models with high HER2 expression and high HER2 gene copy number. In vitro, S3751 inhibited proliferation of HER2-positive SKBR-3 and BT474 breast cancer cells, and it induced apoptosis of these cells \[[@B39]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S3752 is not fully understood, but several explanations have been proposed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3754 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3754 is as follows. S3754 binds to the S-subunit of PP2A, which dephosphorylates the serine in the inhibitory tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, leading to the activation of PP2A. The PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of PIM1 results in the downregulation of PIM1 expression, and the dephosphorylation of GSK3β, leading to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3β.

However, S3754 is also a PP2A-binding compound, and the structure of the compound has not been clarified. Therefore, we decided to clarify the mechanism of action of S3754 by analyzing the crystal structure of the complex between S3754 and PP2A. The complex structure was determined using a co-cry

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3755 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3755 is currently unknown, but it may inhibit the kinase activity of mTOR by binding to the catalytic cleft of mTOR and interfering with ATP binding or by blocking mTOR's substrate binding sites.^[@bib31]^

The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest that dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. The lack of toxicity and selectivity of S3755 was consistent with the lack of toxicity and selectivity of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin,^[@bib32]^ and its low micromolar IC~50~ for mTOR inhibition and its poor solubility in aqueous solution limit its clinical development. However, the lack of mTORC1/mTORC2 selectivity is likely to be an important consideration for further development.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3756 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3756 is likely to be similar to that of a conventional immunosuppressant such as cyclosporine. However, unlike conventional immunosuppressants, S3756 does not appear to bind to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and therefore is not a substrate for P-gp. Further, the inhibitory effect of S3756 on the production of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, is different from that of cyclosporine, and may be mediated by different mechanisms. For example, S3756 suppresses the production of IL-2, but not IFN-γ, through an NF-κB-dependent pathway, which is distinct from the p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways that mediate the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ by T cells. In addition, S3756 inhibits IL-2 production by T cells, but not IL-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3758 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3758 is not known. Although S3758 is not active in TZD-treated cells, it has been reported that the TZD-binding site overlaps with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) binding site and may therefore inhibit PPARγ activity (Liu et al., [@B16]). This may explain why S3758 had no effect on adipogenesis.

As with all novel adipocyte-selective compounds, it is important to consider the risk of off-target effects. One of the reasons that a synthetic TZD agonist has not been developed as a therapeutic is the concern of potential cardiac toxicity. While S3758 did not affect cell viability, the presence of a fluorinated benzoquinone group raises the concern of cardiac toxicity, as do other adipocyte-selective compounds such as APDC (Zhang et al., [@B30]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3763 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3763 is unclear. There are no data from in vitro or in vivo assays that can explain this effect. However, this may be related to the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is expressed in different cells including microglia. RAGE is a receptor for the AGE-protein, which plays a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. RAGE activation leads to the activation of a transcription factor that can regulate apoptosis in a positive or negative manner. Furthermore, this activation can lead to the release of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteinases. Thus, RAGE could be a potential target for treating CNS diseases including Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) and cerebral ischemia (Shimohama et al., [@B85]; Ben-Sasson et al., [@B5]).

The proposed phase I clinical trial is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of S3769 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will evaluate S3769 as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, and gemcitabine. The trial will also determine the maximum tolerated dose of S3769.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3770 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3770 is based on the inhibition of the binding of specific cytokines to their cognate receptors. Cytokines are key regulators of inflammation and have been shown to play an important role in several disease processes including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and many others \[[@CR1]\]. Their binding to their receptors activates signaling pathways that mediate cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis \[[@CR2]\]. Therefore, inhibition of the binding of cytokines to their receptors by blocking their cognate receptors could be an effective approach for the treatment of these diseases.

S3770 is a selective antagonist of the human IL-1R1 receptor and is a potent inhibitor of the binding of IL-1β to the human IL-1R1 receptor. In vitro, S3770 was shown to block the binding of IL-1β to its cogn

Mechanism of action

S3772 is a cell cycle specific agent that is active in a broad spectrum of cell lines.

S3772 causes accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The compound has a concentration-dependent effect on G2/M arrest. The duration of G2/M arrest is prolonged in a concentration-dependent manner, with cells being blocked for >24 hr. The effects of S3772 on cell cycle distribution are irreversible.

The mechanism of action of S3772 is not known. The compound is a cell cycle specific agent that is active in a broad spectrum of cell lines.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3773 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3773 is believed to be through the inhibition of the proteasome, as demonstrated by the significant increase in the proteasome inhibitor MG132-induced accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in cells. Moreover, the inhibition of the proteasome by S3773 is selective, since the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) are not affected by S3773. Our data provide a rationale for the further development of S3773 as a new class of proteasome inhibitor for cancer therapy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3775 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3775 is still unknown, but it has been shown to induce apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines, including AML cells, in the presence of cytarabine. It is also believed to induce the apoptosis of AML cells via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway \[[@CR31]\]. In the present study, we found that AML cell lines were sensitive to S3775 treatment, but the effect was not so obvious in primary AML cells. This is consistent with the result that the sensitivity of AML cell lines to S3775 was stronger than that of primary AML cells. Our results indicated that primary AML cells are resistant to S3775 treatment. We also found that S3775 could induce apoptosis in primary AML cells in the presence of cytarabine. It is known that primary AML cells are resistant to apoptosis, and this may be one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of AML

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3779 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3779 is unique, as it is the only antimicrobial compound in its class to selectively inhibit bacterial GK and have no effect on the mammalian GK. The inhibition of GK activity by S3779 and the associated disruption of the cellular homeostasis of amino acids and purines could provide a unique mechanism for the selective inhibition of bacterial GK and the consequent killing of bacterial cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3781 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3781 is still unclear, although a report by West *et al*. \[[@b26-pharmaceuticals-04-00176]\] has shown that S3781 acts by the inhibition of GSK-3*β*. The inhibition of GSK-3*β* in neurons induces a hyperphosphorylation of tau, leading to its aggregation and formation of NFTs \[[@b27-pharmaceuticals-04-00176]\]. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the incubation of neurons with S3781 leads to a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated tau \[[@b26-pharmaceuticals-04-00176]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3783 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3783 is mediated through the phosphorylation of NF-κB/IκBα. NF-κB is a ubiquitous family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of a large number of genes involved in a variety of physiological processes, including immunity and inflammation, as well as in tumor development.
NF-κB proteins are normally present in an inactive state in the cytoplasm of most cells. In response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, viral antigens, and bacterial and fungal products, NF-κB is activated by the sequential phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory subunit, IκB. This causes NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to specific sequences in the promoter regions of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3785 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3785 is not fully understood. However, it has been shown to inhibit a number of different protein kinases including the CDK2 and CK2 kinases, both of which are involved in the control of the cell cycle. CDK2 and CK2 are both involved in the control of the cell cycle and they have both been implicated in oncogenesis. For example, increased CK2 activity has been found in certain tumour cells and the activity of CK2 has been correlated with malignant potential in human cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of CK2 has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression and to promote apoptosis in certain cell types. CDK2 activity has also been shown to play a role in cancer. CDK2 activity has been found to be increased in certain cancer cells, where it is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Accordingly, it would be expected that inhibition of CDK2 would reduce the growth of cancer cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3791 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3791 is as follows: S3791 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR1 and FGFR3, which are important for normal growth and differentiation of the reproductive tract. It also inhibits FGFR2 and FGFR4, which are involved in processes other than reproduction, but can be stimulated by the FGF ligand in the environment. Thus, S3791 blocks the signaling pathway of FGF ligands and receptors, and thus, prevents abnormal growth and differentiation.
The pharmacokinetics of S3791 were determined in both a Phase I study in cancer patients (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00341033) and in a phase I study in healthy volunteers (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00141441). The plasma half-life was approximately 6.4 hours and the mean residence time was approximately 12.6 hours. The absolute bioavailability was low, which is consistent with the mechanism

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3794 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3794 is unknown, but it is probably related to its effects on the Wnt signaling pathway. This mechanism is based on the inactivation of the key enzyme in this pathway, GSK3, which prevents the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex. In the absence of this complex, β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and activates the expression of several genes, including c-myc, cyclin D1 and MMP-7, which can promote the growth and invasion of tumor cells \[[@R1]\]. The antitumor activity of S3794 is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials.

Another compound that is being evaluated in phase I clinical trials is the imidazo\[1,2-a\]pyridine derivative ABT-414, which also inhibits GSK3β and can also activate β-catenin. It has been shown that ABT-414

S3797 (a 2,4-pyridine derivative) was synthesized and purified as previously described \[[@R17]\]. S3797 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a stock solution of 10 mM, which was stored at −20°C. A serial dilution of the S3797 stock solution was prepared to give a final concentration range of 0.001 to 10 μM.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3798 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3798 is unclear but it has been suggested that the primary target of S3798 is the N-terminal catalytic domain of TβR-I. S3798 binds to the same binding site as TβR-I-binding antibodies (TβR-IBAs) \[[@CR25]\] and these agents have similar effects in preclinical models of lung disease \[[@CR26]\]. The selective TβR-IBAs are effective in reducing lung fibrosis and improving the survival of patients with IPF \[[@CR26]\]. In contrast, S3798 does not improve the survival of IPF patients and only attenuates fibrosis in a limited number of preclinical models \[[@CR26]\]. This lack of efficacy may be related to the lack of anti-fibrotic effects of S3798 in preclinical models \[[@CR26]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S3801 is unknown. We conducted an open-label, nonrandomized, single-center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S3801 in pediatric patients. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the participating site and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians before any study-related procedures were performed.

**Study design and population.** We conducted a phase I, open-label, nonrandomized study of S3801 in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors who had received ≥2 previous lines of therapy and had received prior treatment with at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or had documented TKI resistance.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3802 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3802 is that it increases calcium concentration in the cytoplasm, and activates calmodulin. Calmodulin is a regulatory protein that can activate and inactivate calcium channels. The activated calmodulin can stimulate PKA, which is a protein kinase that inactivates cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA). This allows for the PKA to deactivate and thus open the L-type calcium channels. Thus, the activated calmodulin allows for more calcium ions to enter the cell.

This medication has been tested in the following clinical trials.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3805 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3805 is the same as that of thrombolytic agents such as plasminogen activator. In a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, S3805 significantly reduced the infarct size (31%) and improved the survival rate of mice after treatment (70%). These results suggest that S3805 has the potential to be used as a thrombolytic agent for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
===========

The results of the present study show that S3805, a derivative of urokinase, can activate the blood coagulation system by direct activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. This activation was observed in the presence of fibrin, and it was attenuated by the addition of heparin. Furthermore, in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, S3805 reduced the infarct size

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3807 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3807 is poorly understood. It is unclear whether the pro-apoptotic effects of S3807 are due to the inhibition of specific proteins or to the global inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Since there are multiple E3 ligases that ubiquitinate cyclin E, it is possible that the anti-tumor effects of S3807 are due to the inhibition of an unidentified E3 ligase. It is also possible that the pro-apoptotic effects of S3807 are due to its ability to increase the intracellular levels of the cyclin E protein.

The main limitations of our study are that we were unable to determine the exact mechanism of action of S3807. It is possible that S3807 could be acting as a novel cyclin E inhibitor that could be blocking the activity of a yet unidentified E3 ligase. Further studies are needed to identify the exact mechanism of action of S380

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3810 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3810 is unclear. S3810 may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. We also investigated the apoptosis of HL-60 cells by S3810 treatment using flow cytometry. After treatment with S3810 for 48 h, apoptosis of HL-60 cells was increased in a dose-dependent manner.

We investigated the cytotoxic activity of S3810 in an in vivo model. Mice with established B16F10 melanoma were treated with S3810, and tumor size was measured over the next 5 days. S3810 treatment significantly reduced tumor size compared with vehicle-treated control mice. In addition, there was no apparent toxicity observed in S3810-treated mice. S3810 was more potent than the clinically used anti-tumor agent cisplatin. The results of the present study indicate that S3810 is a potential anticancer agent.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3811 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3811 is complex and involves not only suppression of tumour growth but also direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells and immunomodulatory activity. The safety and efficacy of S3811 has been evaluated in a phase I/II trial in patients with advanced solid tumours. This trial demonstrated the favourable safety profile of S3811 and also suggested that S3811 was effective in treating patients with a variety of advanced solid tumours, including some that were refractory to conventional treatments. The combination of S3811 with low-dose IL-2 showed additive activity. In conclusion, S3811 has shown promising activity in advanced solid tumours.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3817 is thought to involve induction of the terminal differentiation of melanocytes and down-regulation of c-kit and c-fms, and up-regulation of the tyrosinase gene. S3817 has also been reported to have a direct cytotoxic effect on murine melanoma cells in vitro. In vivo, S3817 has shown significant activity against B16 melanoma cells and a human melanoma cell line.

S3817 has shown a low propensity for skin irritation and is effective in both murine and guinea pig models of cutaneous melanoma. S3817 has also been shown to be effective in inhibiting the growth of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3821 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3821 is similar to that of MK-8867, but the kinetics of S3821 are different from those of MK-8867. S3821 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of MK-8867-sensitive MKs (Figs. [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"} and [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). In contrast, MK-8867 is a competitive inhibitor of MKs ([@B11]). Thus, it is thought that the binding of S3821 to MKs occurs at the MK binding site and the inhibitor acts in a manner similar to that of MK-8867. On the other hand, the inhibition of S3821-sensitive MKs was completely abolished by pretreatment with Na^+^-free medium or by treatment with a cocktail of protein phosphatase inhibitors (Figs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3835 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3835 is unclear. However, its activity may be related to a combination of phosphorylation of proteins and inactivation of kinases.

The study by Li *et al*. showed that S3835 significantly inhibited the growth of H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 100 μM, the inhibitory effect was 50% (IC~50~). In addition, the compound induced the apoptosis of H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was confirmed by a number of apoptotic markers, including caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, PARP, and Bax. The results also showed that S3835 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and 4E-BP1. S3835 also inhibited the activation of NF-κB, suggesting that S3835 may be a NF-κB inhibitor.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3839 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3839 is thought to involve induction of apoptosis, possibly by direct targeting of mitochondrial function or inhibition of cellular proliferation. There are two published reports of pre-clinical data on S3839. In one study in a murine colon cancer model, S3839 was reported to reduce tumour burden and improve survival when administered as a single agent, and to increase survival when administered in combination with an MEK inhibitor (PD901). In a second study, S3839 was found to enhance the efficacy of 5-FU when used as a single agent or in combination. These data were supported by an additional pre-clinical study in a murine colon cancer model, which showed that S3839 increased tumour apoptosis when used in combination with 5-FU and reduced proliferation in combination with 5-FU.
In addition, S3839 has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured human breast cancer cells, and to reduce the growth of human prostate cancer xen

Response: The mechanism of action of S3846 is unknown, but the compound shows good efficacy against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and more potent activity than standard therapy, including the purine nucleoside analog cytarabine, in acute myeloid leukemia.  A phase II clinical trial of S3846 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML was completed in 2009, but was halted due to an unexpectedly high rate of severe neutropenia.

History
S3846 was discovered at the pharmaceutical company Isis Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 2000 by Robert M.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3851 is different from that of sorafenib, and this agent induces cell cycle arrest by activating the ATM/p53 and ERK pathways in cancer cells.[@b17-ott-9-3603] Our results also showed that S3851 induces cell cycle arrest in human hepatoma cell lines by activating the ATM/p53 pathway, and thus the growth inhibition of these cells was significantly increased. In addition, we also observed that S3851 could increase the expression of p53 and its downstream targets, such as p21, in a time-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the previous study that S3851 increases p53 and its downstream target p21 in human hepatoma cell lines.[@b17-ott-9-3603]

Our results also showed that S3851 could induce apoptosis in human hepatoma cell lines. The caspase-dependent and -independent pathways were involved in S3851

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3852 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3852 is currently unknown. However, its effects on memory in rats suggest that S3852 may act through an anti-amnesic effect. In order to determine if S3852 would be effective in the treatment of AD, we examined its ability to reverse memory impairment in the amnesic mouse model of AD, TgCRND8 mice. The TgCRND8 mouse model is a mouse model of AD in which beta-amyloid peptide is overexpressed in the brain of the mice. This overexpression causes a significant memory deficit in the mice. The present study demonstrated that S3852 reversed the memory deficit in the TgCRND8 mice.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3853 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3853 is unclear. One possibility is that S3853 inhibits the activity of a protein kinase required for cytokinesis, such as aurora kinase A, the target of ZM447439. It has been shown that aurora kinase A is required for cytokinesis in mammalian cells, and S3853 may be a more specific inhibitor of aurora kinase A than ZM447439 ([@b16]). However, the level of inhibition of aurora kinase A by S3853 was similar to that of ZM447439 ([@b16]). Thus, S3853 may be acting by a different mechanism. Another possibility is that S3853 may be affecting protein phosphorylation. For example, the phosphorylation of H2AX is known to be important for proper chromosome segregation ([@b3]). Thus, S3853 may inhibit the phosphorylation of a protein required for cytokinesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3856 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3856 is based on the inhibition of the function of the active site of CDKs. Therefore, inhibition of CDKs by S3856 is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In a previous study, we reported that S3856 has significant antitumor activity against human lung cancer cells, which was mainly due to its inhibition of the activity of CDK2. However, in the present study, we demonstrated that S3856 also has antitumor activity against a human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, and that this activity was independent of the inhibition of CDK2. Moreover, S3856 induced apoptosis of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the results of a cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. The present study showed that the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 was increased in S3856-treated PANC-1 cells, suggesting that S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3861 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3861 is different from that of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is a macrolide and binds to intracellular protein calcineurin, which results in the inhibition of T cell activation and, consequently, the suppression of IL-2 production. The main effects of S3861 are to inhibit the function of several enzymes, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and calcineurin, which lead to the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling molecules. Therefore, the action of S3861 is different from that of tacrolimus.

In this study, the safety and efficacy of S3861 in treating transplant-related infections were evaluated in kidney transplant recipients with high-risk factors for infection. The overall infection rate was 33.8%, and the rate of infectious episodes was 8

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3872 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3872 is poorly understood. Its lack of effect on Nrf2-dependent transcriptional activity suggests that S3872 may exert its effects by inhibiting Keap1-mediated ubiquitination of Nrf2. To test this hypothesis, we performed *in vitro* ubiquitination assays using recombinant Keap1, Nrf2, and various E3 ligases. Consistent with a previous report ([@b13-bt-23-301]), we found that S3872 significantly reduced the ubiquitination of Nrf2 by MAF, but not by Keap1 ([Fig. 3A](#f3-bt-23-301){ref-type="fig"}). The effect of S3872 was concentration-dependent, and maximal inhibition was observed at 10 μM ([Fig. 3B](#f3-bt-23-301){ref-type="fig"}). In addition, S3872 did

Response: The mechanism of action of S3876 is different from the currently available drugs for treating T2DM, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in several clinical studies.^[@bib9]^ It was suggested that S3876 works by lowering glucose and lipid levels and by improving insulin resistance,^[@bib10]^ and the ability of S3876 to lower plasma glucose in STZ-diabetic rats was also observed in the present study. The level of HbA1c is a reliable marker of glycemic control over the past 2--3 months, and the HbA1c level has been used as a predictor of diabetes-related complications.^[@bib11]^ S3876 significantly decreased the level of HbA1c, which indicates that S3876 is able to reduce blood glucose and may improve diabetes-related complications.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3881 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3881 is unknown. It may be related to the role of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in regulating smooth muscle contraction by regulating the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC). In smooth muscle, MLCK is activated by phosphorylation and in turn phosphorylates RLC. Phosphorylated RLC interacts with myosin heavy chain (MHC) and enhances its ATPase activity. This increased ATPase activity leads to the increased cross-bridge cycling between actin and myosin filaments. This results in the contraction of the smooth muscle.

A further mechanism by which S3881 may act is through the modulation of intracellular calcium concentration. The activation of smooth muscle contraction is accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. S3881 may be acting to prevent this increase in intracellular calcium concentration.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3883 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3883 is similar to that of the pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines (PZP) \[[@B11-molecules-22-01079]\]. PZP is a potent non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), which binds to the thumb-palm-finger domain of the enzyme. The PZP-binding pocket is located in the RT fingers subdomain and is formed by a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the palm subdomain and an entrance to the solvent. PZP binds in the tunnel and occupies the palm subdomain in the absence of nucleic acids. It interacts with a specific nucleic acid-dependent RT conformation, blocking the DNA- and primer-binding sites. S3883 is expected to bind to the same pocket as PZP, thereby competing with nucleic acids.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3885 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3885 is based on an oral pharmacokinetic profile with a short half-life, reaching high concentrations in the CNS, which results in an increased safety margin compared to conventional neuroleptics. It was shown to be effective in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in several studies, including a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III trial in patients with acute bipolar mania.

Response: The mechanism of action of S3889 is complex and may be associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth through the VEGF receptor, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. In addition, S3889 has been reported to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cells through inhibition of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway \[[@B27-ijms-19-00139]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3890 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3890 is a highly selective inhibitor of PARP-1. PARP-1 is an enzyme involved in DNA repair and transcription. Inhibition of PARP-1 activity results in depletion of the cellular NAD+ pool, causing depletion of cellular ATP levels, DNA damage and apoptosis. In contrast to other PARP inhibitors, S3890 is a potent PARP-1 inhibitor (IC50=0.1 nM) but has no significant activity against PARP-2 (IC50>1,000 nM). S3890 is highly selective for PARP-1, showing only weak activity against a panel of 190 different kinases. The compound is also highly potent in cell-based assays (IC50=1.5 nM) and shows a high degree of oral bioavailability.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3898 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3898 is not completely understood. It is possible that S3898 interferes with the activity of the proline-rich ligand binding domain of FGFR1. It is also possible that S3898 inhibits the binding of FGFR1 to its cognate ligands. S3898 may also interact with the active site of FGFR1 and block the binding of its cognate ligands. In either case, S3898 may inhibit the FGFR1 signaling pathway and block the growth and survival of FGFR1-dependent tumor cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3901 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3901 is complex, and its action mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. The action of S3901 is considered to be a result of combined action of multiple factors. However, the possibility that S3901 has an anti-metastatic effect by inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells cannot be excluded.

In a Phase I clinical trial for patients with solid tumors, S3901 was shown to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. S3901 has a long half-life, and is therefore considered to be a candidate for continuous administration. The results of this trial indicated that the optimal administration schedule was daily intravenous infusion of S3901 for 28 days repeated every 4 weeks.

The results of this Phase I trial showed that the MTD of S3901 was 3.0 mg/m^2^, and the recommended dose for the Phase II trial was 2.5 mg/m^

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3905 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3905 is believed to involve a combination of effects on tumor cells and on the tumor vasculature. These effects are as follows: 1) S3905 exerts a potent and selective antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the binding of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to the bFGF receptor, KDR/Flk-1, which is found on tumor endothelial cells, tumor cells, and inflammatory cells. The result of the inhibition of the bFGF/KDR/Flk-1 interaction is the blockade of endothelial cell growth and migration. 2) S3905 also acts on the tumor cells themselves, and can potentiate the cytotoxic effect of other antitumor drugs, including those in clinical use. 3) S3905 is also a potent antiangiogenic agent. The results of these studies are the basis for the following: 1) S3905 was shown

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3909 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3909 is based on the conjugation of alkylating groups to nucleic acid bases, the conjugation being through a heteroatom (in this case sulfur) which is not a member of the nucleic acid base. The conjugated nucleic acid bases form DNA-protein crosslinks and DNA-DNA crosslinks. S3909 has been shown to be highly active in both solid tumors and leukemias. The data also showed that S3909 was active in hematologic malignancies which had been previously resistant to alkylating agents.
A clinical study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who had failed prior chemotherapy with conventional agents was performed. Twenty-eight patients with AML were treated with S3909.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3914 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3914 is thought to be through inhibition of the Wnt pathway. S3914 binds to and inhibits the β-catenin destruction complex, which includes the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) ([@B5]). Inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex in this way results in β-catenin accumulation and stabilization in the cytoplasm, which ultimately leads to the upregulation of downstream target genes. S3914 treatment of colorectal cancer cell lines was shown to inhibit growth, reduce tumorigenicity, and increase apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3919 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3919 is a complex interplay between several key elements of its structure and the molecular interactions with the lipid bilayer that drive its activity. S3919 contains a bisphenolic motif, and two additional bisphenolic motifs that are connected to the pyridine nitrogen. The former two are highly lipophilic and the latter two are lipophilic, but polar. The bisphenolic motif is connected to a fluorophilic moiety, and the polar motifs are connected to a polar group. Thus, the molecules form a bundle in the bilayer and are held in the plane of the membrane by the hydrophobic moieties and the membrane.

S3919 is also a membrane-active molecule, since it reduces the membrane potential of *S. aureus* and inhibits the activity of an essential respiratory enzyme. The S3919-membrane interactions are further complicated by the ability of S3919 to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3923 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3923 is based on the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and the subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) \[[@B43-ijms-21-00557]\]. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the combination of VD and S3923 would synergistically induce apoptosis. However, the combination of VD and S3923 did not enhance apoptosis, as measured by the number of cells with fragmented DNA and caspase-3 activity, in all tested cells ([Figure 2](#ijms-21-00557-f002){ref-type="fig"}).

Since apoptosis is regulated by several molecules, the anti-proliferative effects of the VD and S3923 combination could be explained by the induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and/or senescence. We tested these hypotheses in prostate cancer cells.

The latter two products may then undergo further reaction and form the bioactive aglycone and aldehyde products.^[@bib20]^ The mechanism of action of F2-102 is a nucleophilic addition reaction between a cysteine residue and a carbonyl group to generate a sulfenic acid intermediate, which is then converted to the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone by the nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxide on the carbonyl group.^[@bib19]^

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3926 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3926 is mediated through both the blockade of the NMDA receptor and inhibition of the glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. S3926 attenuated glutamate release and reduced the over-activation of glutamate receptors in the CNS of neuropathic rats \[[@CR19]\]. Therefore, we considered that S3926 might also affect glutamate receptors in the DRG of neuropathic rats. The results showed that S3926 treatment decreased the mRNA expression of NR1 and NR2B in the DRG of SNL rats. The NR1 and NR2B subunits are the most abundant subunits of the NMDA receptor \[[@CR20]\]. The binding of glutamate to the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor induces channel opening and results in Ca^2+^ influx, which causes the release of glutamate and other neurotransmitters. The binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor is a key step in the development

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3927 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3927 is not yet clear. However, it has been reported that it is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A4. In the current study, S3927 was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg to rats. After dosing, plasma concentrations of S3927 were found to be 1.15 μM. This level of plasma concentration is lower than the IC50 value of S3927 for CYP3A4 (16 μM). This may explain why the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of S3927 was observed to be long. The area under the plasma concentration--time curve (AUC) of S3927 was increased by 1.35-fold after oral administration of S3927 to rats. However, the metabolic stability of S3927 was low. This may be due to the low plasma concentration of S3927. The mean half-life of S3927 was found

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3930 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3930 is the production of the free radical nitric oxide (NO), which acts on the vascular endothelium to produce vasodilation. NO has an important role in the cardiovascular system, including in regulating vascular tone and platelet aggregation, inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation, and acting as a neurotransmitter. NO is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by the action of NO synthase.
S3930 is an oral prodrug of NO, which can be converted to NO by the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase, in the intestinal mucosa.
In vitro data suggest that S3930 may have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of patients with stable or unstable angina pectoris, or in the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3935 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3935 is unknown. However, the low molecular weight of the compound and the absence of potent CYP3A4 inhibition and induction at the therapeutic doses would suggest that S3935 does not inhibit CYP3A4. As it is not known whether S3935 is metabolized by any other metabolic enzymes than CYP3A4, it cannot be excluded that S3935 also has an effect on other metabolic enzymes.

In conclusion, this study showed that S3935 was a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and that it was a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. However, the drug-drug interaction potential of S3935 appears to be minimal, as it is unlikely that co-administration of S3935 and CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 substrates will cause clinically relevant interactions.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3944 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3944 is based on the inhibition of the NHE-1 (Na+/H+ exchanger-1) transporter and the consequent increase in intracellular sodium, causing the swelling of the mitochondria. The swelling of the mitochondria is related to the activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which causes the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c. These events result in the activation of caspase 3 and, subsequently, in apoptosis \[[@B1-ijms-19-00139]\].

It has been demonstrated that the inhibition of NHE-1 causes the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation \[[@B1-ijms-19-00139],[@B2-ijms-19-00139],[@B3-ijms-19-00139],[@B4-ijms-19-00139]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3945 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3945 is the disruption of the replication fork. S3945 has a broad spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses and does not have the same toxicity profile as AZT. S3945 has been studied in patients with AIDS and in HIV-infected individuals who have been intolerant of AZT.

The major adverse effect associated with S3945 is peripheral neuropathy, with about 30% of patients experiencing this toxicity. The rate of peripheral neuropathy is similar to that of AZT, and in some studies it has been reported to be higher. The rate of nausea, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms is also higher than that with AZT.

S3945 was the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor to be approved for use in combination with AZT and 3TC. It has been shown to have an additive or synergistic effect when used with AZT and 3TC.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3946 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3946 is not completely understood. One possible mechanism of action is the inhibition of fibrillogenesis by interfering with the aggregation of PrP^Sc^ into amyloid plaques. In this study, the levels of soluble PrP^Sc^ were reduced after the treatment of S3946. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that soluble PrP^Sc^ is associated with disease progression.^[@R10],[@R12]^ The reduced level of PrP^Sc^ in S3946-treated mice suggests that the treatment of S3946 has a therapeutic effect on prion disease. The reduction of PrP^Sc^ levels is probably due to the degradation of PrP^Sc^ by S3946. The increase of CWD-specific antibodies in S3946-treated mice indicates that the reduction of PrP^Sc^ levels by S3946 may be due to the reduction of PrP^Sc^ in

The final stage of clinical development was terminated in 2009. The main reason for the termination of phase III clinical trials was that the molecule did not demonstrate any therapeutic efficacy in a phase III trial.

--------------------

S3948 was developed by Incyte Corporation and was identified as a potential AID inhibitor based on the discovery of the structure of the ubiquitin-like protein modifier (UBL) system. The UBL system is conserved from yeast to humans and plays a role in protein degradation, but is also involved in other cellular processes. The AID inhibitor S3948 was designed based on the crystal structure of a *T. cruzi* ubiquitin-like protein ligase (TcUBL1) ([@B6]). This

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3953 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3953 is still unclear. While S3953 is a potent inhibitor of β-lactamase, the lack of inhibition of a number of clinically relevant β-lactamases by S3953 suggests that S3953 is unlikely to be a broad spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor. However, the clinical isolates examined were β-lactamase negative, and the lack of activity of S3953 against some enzymes, including some chromosomally encoded enzymes, suggests that S3953 may be an effective inhibitor of enzymes other than those that have been tested. S3953 has a potent bactericidal activity in the *in vitro* time-kill studies, and the synergy with aztreonam indicates that S3953 may have a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative organisms. However, the PK/PD results suggest that S3953 is unlikely to be active against P. aeruginosa. The efficacy of S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3963 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3963 is poorly understood. In addition to an increase in lymphocyte apoptosis, we found that S3963 induces a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of activated lymphocytes. As ΔΨm is a key parameter in the apoptotic process, we also evaluated the effect of S3963 on the apoptosis of Jurkat cells, a human T-lymphocyte leukemia cell line, which can be used as a model for studying apoptosis. S3963 inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis of Jurkat cells and also reduced the apoptosis induced by other stimuli such as anti-Fas, cycloheximide, and dexamethasone. We also found that S3963 inhibited caspase-3 and -9 activities and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. We conclude that S3963 is a promising new agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3965 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3965 is not fully understood. It is known to inhibit the enzymatic activity of PDE4D, and its binding to the PDE4D protein is through a hydrophobic region in the catalytic domain of the enzyme \[[@B40]\]. However, unlike other PDE4 inhibitors, S3965 also has an affinity for the PDE4D receptor. S3965 has been shown to be a more potent PDE4 inhibitor in comparison to rolipram, and in addition, it has a greater affinity for the PDE4D receptor. This has been suggested to be the reason why S3965 has a longer half-life in the blood than rolipram \[[@B40]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3968 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3968 is not completely understood. S3968 is believed to inhibit the proton pump in the bacterial membrane. Bacteria are known to be dependent on the proton motive force to energize the membrane transport processes, including the ATP-dependent transport of molecules across the membrane. The decrease in proton motive force caused by the inhibition of the proton pump leads to a reduction in the number of substrate-transport systems that are active.
The antibacterial activity of S3968 was first reported in a paper by Popoff et al. in 1988. (P. Popoff et al., "A new peptide antibiotic: S3968," Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 32:4, 441-445 (1988)).

Response: The mechanism of action of S3973 is unknown. S3973 did not affect binding of radiolabelled CGRP or CGRP8-37 to human calcitonin receptor-like receptor (hCRLR). However, in a ligand-dependent manner, S3973 displaced bound CGRP and CGRP8-37 from hCRLR in transfected cells. Moreover, S3973 potently antagonised the biological effects of CGRP on cAMP production in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing hCRLR, as well as in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. The inhibitory effects of S3973 on CGRP-induced cAMP production were blocked by co-administration of the selective antagonist hCGRP8-37.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3982 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3982 is believed to involve disruption of p53-MDM2 interaction leading to MDM2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A major challenge in cancer treatment is the identification of novel targets for which the drugs are selectively toxic to cancer cells, but not to normal cells. S3982 is active against a broad spectrum of tumor cell lines including colon, breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers, melanoma, and glioblastoma. In addition, S3982 is highly active in combination with other targeted therapies such as the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib, in NSCLC.
S3982 is a highly potent MDM2 inhibitor with in vitro IC50 of ˜1 nM. In addition, S3982 has been shown to effectively inhibit MDM2 activity in vivo in tumor models. S3982 was active in tumor models against multiple human tumor types including breast, ovarian, prostate, lung

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3983 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3983 is complex and involves both the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the inhibition of phosphodiesterase. These effects lead to an increase in cAMP levels, an increase in the amount of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity and an increase in the phosphorylation of downstream effectors. The combination of these effects leads to the inhibition of IL-6 production in monocytes and the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes ([@bib32]).

In this study, we demonstrate that S3983 has significant anti-inflammatory activity in a model of acute peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3984 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3984 is as follows: S3984 binds to TNF-R1 and blocks its interaction with TRAF2. As a result, TRAF2 ubiquitination and degradation are inhibited. Finally, TRAF2 ubiquitination blocks the formation of the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on RIPK1, thus blocking the activation of the downstream kinases, such as IKK, IKKγ and IKKε. Therefore, the phosphorylation and activation of IKK are inhibited. Finally, IKKα/β phosphorylates and activates the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, which then translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of various genes.

S3984 is a first-in-class oral TNF-R1 antagonist that selectively blocks TNF-R1 binding to TRAF2, but not TNF-R2 binding to TRAF2. Therefore, S3984

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3987 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3987 is as follows. S3987 can inhibit the production of angiogenesis factors by the inhibition of transcription and translation. The effects of S3987 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of tumor cells have been studied in vitro and in vivo. S3987 significantly inhibited the expression of VEGF and MMP-2, which is an important enzyme for angiogenesis, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activity of the caspase-3 apoptotic enzyme was significantly increased. The in vivo study demonstrated that the treatment of mice with S3987 significantly inhibited the growth of transplanted tumor cells in nude mice. S3987 significantly inhibited the growth of transplanted tumor cells in nude mice. This effect may be related to the inhibition of angiogenesis and the promotion of apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3992 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3992 is an increase in intestinal fluid absorption, mediated by the P2Y~6~ receptor. In vitro, S3992 stimulates P2Y~6~ receptor-mediated Ca^2+^ influx and subsequently stimulates intestinal fluid absorption. The in vivo data showed that S3992 increased fecal excretion of water, electrolytes and sodium in mice, rats and monkeys, indicating that S3992 could be used as a therapeutic agent for intestinal diseases.

The P2Y~6~ receptor is expressed in the brain, gastrointestinal tract and the kidney.^[@bib14]^ The P2Y~6~ receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor, which is activated by adenosine diphosphate, uridine triphosphate and uridine diphosphate.^[@bib15]^ The activation of P2Y~6~ receptor increases the release of Ca^2

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3996 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3996 is unique in that it activates the AMPK signaling pathway without binding to the adenosine nucleotide-binding domain of AMPK. In the AMPK signaling pathway, AMP binds to the AMP-binding site of the γ subunit of AMPK, resulting in phosphorylation of Thr172 and activation of the AMPK kinase. In contrast, S3996 does not require binding to the adenosine nucleotide-binding domain, but instead interacts with a second site in the catalytic α subunit of AMPK, and this interaction results in phosphorylation of Thr172 of the α subunit of AMPK. This phosphorylation is sufficient to activate AMPK, which in turn phosphorylates various downstream targets.

S3996 was discovered in a high-throughput screen of a library of chemical compounds for inhibitors of AMPK. This screen was designed to identify inhibitors of AMPK that might be used

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3997 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3997 is unclear. In addition to *in vitro* data demonstrating direct binding of the ligand to a variety of cells, S3997 was found to bind to mouse lung tissue, and a direct relationship between S3997-induced effects on IL-6 production and the number of lung-resident macrophages was demonstrated ([@b33]). It is possible that the direct binding of S3997 to lung tissue results in the recruitment of macrophages to the lung. However, the effects of S3997 on the production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages may be secondary to its effects on cytokine production. In addition, there is evidence that S3997 can modulate the effects of LPS on macrophages ([@b22]). These data suggest that S3997 may directly affect the function of macrophages and thus have direct effects on cytokine production.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S3998 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S3998 is unique, as it is the first and only agent to inhibit the receptor for fibrinogen (α~IIb~β~3~ integrin), which has been demonstrated to be a crucial mediator of platelet aggregation, aggregation of endothelial cells, and tumor cell migration and invasion \[[@B4-ijms-20-02176],[@B5-ijms-20-02176],[@B6-ijms-20-02176],[@B7-ijms-20-02176],[@B8-ijms-20-02176]\]. Therefore, S3998 has the potential to be a potent antithrombotic agent in combination with antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor, which are currently used in clinical practice. In addition, S3998 may have a potential to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4002 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4002 is not known. It may have some anti-angiogenic effect by blocking the activity of VEGF receptor, but this remains to be proven. In the present study, we demonstrate that S4002 may have anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on cells.

S4002 is a selective inhibitor of PKCα. It has been reported that PKCα is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, and survival. PKCα is known to be activated by Ca^2+^ and DAG \[[@B21-ijms-16-18683]\]. In addition, PKCα is activated by Ca^2+^-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) \[[@B22-ijms-16-18683]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of s4030 is unknown. Its mode of action is most likely through an increase in phosphorylation of Ser14 of HSPB1, which may lead to a decrease in the interaction between HSPB1 and the unfolded protein response (UPR) components ATF6, IRE1, and XBP1.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4059 is unclear, but its safety profile and pharmacokinetic profile make it a promising drug for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The only other drug that is currently approved for use in type 2 diabetes is exenatide, which is also a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor is expressed throughout the body and stimulates insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor is also expressed in the central nervous system, where it modulates the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, and the GLP-1 receptor agonists, exenatide and S4059, have demonstrated beneficial effects on food intake and body weight in preclinical models.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of s4075 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of s4075 is different from that of other second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. S4075 binds to the polymerase active site of HIV-1 RT and acts as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

S4075 has also been shown to inhibit the replication of human coronavirus OC43, feline coronavirus and equine arteritis virus.

Synthesis
S4075 was developed by researchers at Sanofi-Aventis. The compound was first discovered in 1998.

Mechanism of action
S4075 is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor that works by binding to the active site of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and inhibiting its function.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4117 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4117 is believed to be due to the ability of the compound to bind to and block the interaction of p53 with MDM2, thus preventing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53, leading to a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.

S4117 is a Phase II clinical trial for treatment of advanced solid tumors, with primary objectives to determine the MTD and safety of S4117 when administered by intravenous infusion. Secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics, antitumor activity, and safety of S4117.

In December 2012, Oncothyreon announced the successful completion of a pivotal Phase II trial for S4117. This was the first Phase II clinical trial of an MDM2 inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4246 is not well understood. In this study, we examined the effect of S4246 on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activation and found that S4246 inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and its DNA binding activity in the cells. In addition, S4246 inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and the degradation of IκBα. S4246 also inhibited the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus by inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. In addition, S4246 significantly inhibited the binding of p65 and IκBα in the cells. We also found that S4246 inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells by arresting the cells at the G2/M phase.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4281 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4281 is unclear, but it is assumed that it acts by increasing the production of progesterone in the ovary. It has a positive ovulation rate, which increases with increasing dose. It has a lower rate of ovulation failure than a progestogen-only pill. The ovulation rate is also increased when it is used in combination with a GnRH agonist. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding is higher with S4281 than with other progestogens. The progestogen component of the pill may contribute to breakthrough bleeding in some women. The risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia is higher with S4281 than with other progestogens. In some women, the endometrium may become too thin.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of S4281?

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of s4515 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of s4515 is poorly understood. We demonstrate that s4515 increases mitochondrial membrane potential and decreases reactive oxygen species generation in the cells. It also induces apoptosis in the cells by increasing Bax and reducing Bcl-2 levels, which is followed by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, s4515 decreases levels of ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and reduces activities of the mitochondrial enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and complex I. These effects are associated with a decrease in the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione. It also increases the level of the DNA damage response marker γ-H2A.X and reduces the expression of the DNA repair proteins XRCC1, PARP-1, and Ku70. In addition, s4515 decreases

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4516 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4516 is yet to be determined, but one can hypothesize that the drug acts on cell membrane permeability, as it is known that the solubility of the drug in water is about 1.4 µg/mL \[[@B22-pharmaceutics-12-00558]\]. However, the aqueous solubility of S4516 was only about 5 µg/mL \[[@B22-pharmaceutics-12-00558]\]. In the present study, the data on membrane permeability showed that the drug was not absorbed through the intestine, but instead it was transported across the epithelial barrier via transcellular transport. As a consequence, the concentration of S4516 in the intestine is about 2-fold higher than in plasma ([Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-12-00558-f002){ref-type="fig"}). It is known that the perme

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4520 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4520 is unknown. We can only speculate that it may act on the myocardium directly or indirectly via the sympathetic nervous system.

Conclusion {#Sec5}
==========

This study demonstrates that S4520 may be a promising new agent for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction. S4520 exerts its cardioprotective effects via two independent mechanisms: the mitoK~ATP~ channel and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.

Study limitations {#Sec6}
-----------------

This study has several limitations. First, this is an ex vivo study and the findings are not necessarily relevant to in vivo conditions. Second, we only used male animals and the results may not be applicable to female animals. Third, the dose of S4520 used in this study was relatively high and the concentration was not reached in the heart, so the effect of the drug may be underestimated. Finally

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4550 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4550 is believed to be by blocking the release of the proteolytic enzyme trypsinogen, thus stopping the development of the early phase of the allergic response.

S4550 is the first and only pharmaceutical product approved for use in the treatment of early phase allergic reactions and is available in Europe and Japan.

S4550 has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and is being evaluated for this indication in the US.

The company's Phase III development programme includes a pivotal study in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. The study will compare the efficacy and safety of S4550 to placebo and other antihistamines. The study is expected to be completed in the second half of 2010.

S4550 is being developed for the treatment of a range of conditions that include seasonal allergic rhinitis, non-seasonal allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic urticaria and mastocytosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4553 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4553 is not fully understood. S4553 has been shown to inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells, including MCF-7, A549, HepG2, and PC-3 cells \[[@B22-molecules-21-01088]\]. However, S4553 has not been evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in an animal model.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4556 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4556 is not known. It is possible that S4556 binds to and inhibits the activity of MMP-2 or MMP-9 or both, or that S4556 acts by blocking the interaction of these MMPs with their natural inhibitors. S4556 could also exert its action by directly interfering with the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 or MMP-9, and/or by interfering with the binding of MMP-2 or MMP-9 to their natural inhibitors.

It is also possible that S4556 inhibits the activity of MMP-2 or MMP-9 indirectly by affecting the activity of another molecule involved in the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 or MMP-9.

The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are regulated by a number of physiological inhibitors, such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1, TIMP

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4558 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4558 is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of MMP-9 \[[@B34-ijms-19-02208]\]. S4558 inhibits the catalytic activity of MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in an inhibition of tumor growth and an increase in tumor cell apoptosis \[[@B35-ijms-19-02208]\]. In addition, it has been shown that S4558 can downregulate the expression of MMP-9 and decrease the expression of VEGF, thereby reducing angiogenesis \[[@B36-ijms-19-02208]\].

S4559 has also been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in cancer cell lines, presumably by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis ([@B23]). In addition, S4559 has shown promise as an anti-inflammatory agent in murine models of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease ([@B24],[@B25]). The effects of S4559 on inflammation in humans are not known.

This study was designed to assess the effects of S4559 on inflammation in humans. S4559 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of adipose tissue lipolysis in vitro ([@B26]), but whether this translates to an anti-inflammatory effect in humans is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of S4559 on biomarkers of inflammation in humans.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4562 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4562 is believed to be similar to that of trastuzumab and the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab. S4562 is thought to bind to the extracellular domain of HER2, thus blocking ligand-induced HER2 dimerization and the downstream activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Science 2006, 311, 647-650). The exact binding epitope of S4562 has not yet been fully elucidated.
S4562 is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody and was engineered to maintain the antigen binding properties of trastuzumab, with modifications in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to increase binding to human HER2. S4562 has a koff rate of 2.9×10−4 min−1 and a kon rate of 3.7×105 min−1, as determined in a biochemical equilibrium

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4565 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4565 is similar to that of valganciclovir, a widely used antiviral agent, in that it inhibits the cytoplasmic DNA polymerase. It differs, however, in its mechanism of delivery. Valganciclovir is taken up into cells via its high-affinity transport system and then converted to its active form by cellular enzymes. S4565 is directly delivered into cells by a lipid carrier that is degraded into a water-soluble compound by the action of an intracellular enzyme. S4565 and its metabolites are incorporated into cellular DNA and RNA and are not removed from the cells by active transport. This property of S4565 is likely to explain the prolonged activity of the drug in vivo. In addition, in contrast to valganciclovir, S4565 is eliminated rapidly from the body by metabolic processes, including urinary excretion.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4571 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4571 is still under investigation, but it is thought to work by preventing C3b from activating the complement system. The study population had no exposure to S4571, so there was no measurement of serum concentrations. However, a lack of response to the treatment in patients with low baseline serum C3 levels would suggest that the drug works by preventing the formation of a terminal complement complex. This may be a novel mechanism of action that can be explored in future clinical trials.

Although there were no statistically significant differences between the placebo and S4571 treatment groups in the study, there were numerically more deaths in the S4571 group, but this was not statistically significant. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution as the small sample size and short follow-up period may not have been sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference. Further investigation is required to confirm these findings.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4580 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4580 is not known. It is believed that the selective 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist activity of S4580 leads to an increased serotonergic tone in the CNS. The compound acts at the 5-HT2C receptor to inhibit serotonin release in the CNS. S4580 is a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist with in vitro affinity at 5-HT2A receptors in the micromolar range and 5-HT2C receptor binding affinity in the nanomolar range. The IC50 of S4580 in a functional assay in vitro at 5-HT2A receptors in rat cortex is 3.6 nM. The IC50 of S4580 in a functional assay in vitro at 5-HT2C receptors in rat cortex is 1.1 nM. S4580 does not appear to be a full agonist or a partial agonist of 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4585 is as follows: 1) it induces autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and 2) it increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tumor cells by activating the MAPK signaling pathway, leading to apoptosis. Therefore, S4585 is an effective inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth and may be a promising new treatment for patients with breast cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4588 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4588 is unknown. It does not appear to have any direct effect on the tumour cells, but it has been suggested that the immune system may be involved in the activity of the drug.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption
S4588 is a rapidly absorbed and eliminated compound. After oral administration, the plasma concentrations of S4588 increase in a linear fashion over the first 3 hours. After this initial rapid rise, the concentration of S4588 in plasma is fairly constant. There is no accumulation of the drug after repeated dosing.

Distribution
S4588 is extensively distributed throughout the body. It is concentrated in the liver, kidney, lungs, heart, spleen, muscle and fat. The concentrations of S4588 in the brain, eyes and skin are low.

Metabolism
The pharmacokinetics of S4588 are not known. The major route of elimination of S4588 is via

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4590 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4590 is unclear. However, the Efficacy Study of S4590 (ES-444) has been completed. The results showed that S4590 was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and that it was well tolerated. In addition, the analgesic effect was not different between subcutaneous and oral administration of S4590.

In this study, S4590 was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and that it was well tolerated.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4591 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4591 is complex and involves induction of apoptosis by inhibition of the binding of the Cdc42 effector p34-Arc/Arp2/3 to GTP-bound RhoA, as well as the downregulation of several growth factor receptors, including the EGFR, Met, and HER2.[@b19-bctt-8-211] In the clinic, S4591 has been evaluated in a Phase I trial of the combination of S4591 with capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had received trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane chemotherapy. Preliminary data indicated that the most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea and vomiting. The combination of S4591 with capecitabine was well tolerated, and there was evidence of anti-tumor activity, including partial responses, in three patients.[@b20-bctt-8-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4592 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4592 is not fully understood, but is presumed to be due to an interaction between the drug and the 3′ end of the TAR sequence.

Activity against HIV-1 is dependent on the amount of the inhibitor used and the HIV-1 subtype, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) ranging from 4 to 40 μM against the CCR5-using strains, but EC50s of over 100 μM against the CXCR4-using strains [43]. In vivo activity was observed in humanized mouse models of HIV-1 infection [44].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4593 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4593 is complex. S4593 causes the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria of breast cancer cells and this can be used to kill the cells. In addition, S4593 induces caspase-independent apoptosis. The primary mechanism of action is induction of the BH3-only proteins, BIM and PUMA, and these proteins trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These proteins can also interact with other BH3-only proteins such as BID, BAD, NOXA and BIK to trigger apoptosis. S4593 has also been shown to induce caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.

S4593 was developed to kill cells in solid tumors. In the NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel, S4593 showed potent cytotoxicity against a wide variety of solid tumors including breast, colon, kidney, ovarian, prostate

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4594 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4594 is still under investigation. While it has been reported that S4594 is an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist \[[@B23]\], a recent report showed that S4594 is a dual adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and adenosine A2B receptor agonist \[[@B24]\]. It is possible that S4594 inhibits the activity of A2A receptors in the pancreas. This is supported by the fact that the islets in the pancreas were identified as A2A receptors \[[@B25]\]. Furthermore, we have reported that S4594 inhibited the secretion of insulin from the pancreatic islets in vitro and in vivo \[[@B17]\].

Previous studies have shown that adenosine inhibits insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner \[[@B26]\]. Therefore, we performed an in vitro study to evaluate the effects

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4595 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4595 is as a polyamine analogue of spiroindolinone. This compound is an orally active and potent inhibitor of protein farnesyltransferase, an enzyme that is essential for the function of many proteins including oncogenic proteins, and for cellular transformation.

The in vivo activity of S4595 was evaluated in mouse xenograft models. In vivo, S4595 exhibited broad activity against several xenograft models, and was well tolerated in mice at oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day. S4595 exhibited potent antitumor activity against human xenografts of a broad range of tissue origins including breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancer. In human xenograft models, S4595 was effective against tumors with high protein farnesylation levels, including human ovarian and pancreatic cancers. In contrast, S4595 did not inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts with low levels of protein

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4596 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4596 is still not completely understood, although it is known that it induces the activation of the STAT3 transcription factor, resulting in the inhibition of the apoptotic process, and the activation of anti-apoptotic and cell survival genes. These effects are also mediated by the suppression of the activation of the NF-kB transcription factor, the inhibition of NF-kB binding to DNA, and the downregulation of the NF-kB-dependent genes (Bcl-2, c-myc, Bcl-XL, cyclin D1, c-jun, and survivin). The anti-proliferative activity of S4596 is also due to the downregulation of c-fos, c-myc, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cdk4 genes, and the induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21^CIP1^.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4597 is related to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) by competing with ATP binding \[[@B9-ijms-21-00783]\]. A recent report by Cammalleri et al. indicated that S4597 could be effective in vitro against most of the common B-cell lymphomas, and also in vivo in the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia \[[@B8-ijms-21-00783]\]. The results of the study are in line with our findings and show that S4597 is also active in vitro against BL and in vivo in the Eµ-TCL1 model.

Our data also indicate that S4597 could be effective in vivo in the Eµ-TCL1 model of lymphoma, but this is not the case for other lymphoma models tested in our study.

Pestiviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome of about 12.3 kb. In contrast to other RNA viruses, pestiviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of their host cells and therefore need to rely on host cell translation machinery. The genomic RNA of pestiviruses encodes one polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into mature viral proteins \[[@B1-toxins-12-00462]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S4609 is not well understood. We hypothesized that S4609 might inhibit proliferation and migration by suppressing cell cycle and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The effect of S4609 on the cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry. As shown in [Fig. 3A](#f3-ijo-50-06-1977){ref-type="fig"}, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase was significantly increased from 42.1% to 58.4% (P\<0.05) in S4609-treated cells. However, the percentage of cells in S phase and G2/M phase was not affected by S4609 treatment. In addition, S4609 treatment induced a decrease in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase, which is indicative of apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4612 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4612 is not yet clear. A recent study in mice showed that this agent may enhance intracellular expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, suggesting that it may be more effective in tumors with low levels of Bcl-2 ([@bib9]). Another study suggested that the antitumor activity of S4612 was associated with an induction of cell death by a process that may involve a caspase-independent mechanism ([@bib17]). In the current study, we show that S4612, which is a small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, does not affect the activity of caspases in colon cancer cells and that S4612 does not induce cell death by apoptosis. These results suggest that the antitumor activity of S4612 may involve inhibition of cell proliferation or a cell cycle arrest that may lead to cell death by a nonapoptotic mechanism.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4617 is still unknown. However, it is clear that this molecule inhibits the HIV-1 virus without inducing resistance mutations and is well tolerated in the human body. As mentioned above, the most promising profile of S4617 is that it is effective against both wild-type and mutant viruses, which is a feature that is not seen with any of the other new agents in development.

The promising profile of S4617, coupled with its safety profile, makes this a promising new compound. S4617 has the potential to be an important new therapeutic option for patients with HIV-1 infection.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4629 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4629 is not completely understood, but it is likely that S4629 exerts its effect on the cell by interfering with intracellular calcium homeostasis and the cell cycle. It has been shown that the elevation of intracellular calcium levels by a single bout of exercise can stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, resulting in a transient increase in the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the extracellular space ([@B12]; [@B24]). Such an increase in neurotransmitter concentration can induce a transient increase in neuronal excitability. As a result, synaptic neurotransmitter release may be enhanced, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and further elevations in neuronal excitability ([@B12]). Moreover, it has been shown that calcium overload in the neuronal cell body can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ([@B8]). Furthermore, [@B7] demonstrated that a single bout of exercise induced a rapid increase in intrace

Response: The mechanism of action of S4632 is still not completely understood. The possibility that S4632 is a phosphatase inhibitor has been considered, but this has not been confirmed. S4632 is known to have a similar chemical structure to bis-dihydroquinolines and is an analogue of fluphenazine. It is also known that the toxicity of the former is reduced in the latter, and this may be the case for S4632.

S4632 is now in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is thought that S4632 may act on a molecular target common to the multiple types of leukemia and lymphoma, and that the compound will have a high efficacy in the treatment of CLL.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4633 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4633 is unknown. It is possible that the observed changes in vascular structure are mediated through actions on the release of the potent vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO).

Although we observed that S4633 reduced the percentage of occluded vessels in the retina, this did not translate into a significant improvement in the functional outcome measured by P2Y12 staining. It is possible that the occlusion time is not long enough to produce any effect on functional outcomes in the current model. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the occlusion time of 30 minutes is long enough to produce a significant functional outcome using the ischaemia model [@pone.0114540-Yamamoto1]. It is also possible that the P2Y12 staining method is not sensitive enough to detect the improvement in the functional outcome in the current model.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4634 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4634 is similar to that of cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) ([@b22-ehp0113-000632]; [@b27-ehp0113-000632]). Mitochondrial permeability transition is involved in cell death, and MPTP opening is regulated by the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), which exchanges adenine nucleotides across the inner mitochondrial membrane ([@b22-ehp0113-000632]). Cyclosporin A blocks the opening of the MPTP, thereby inhibiting the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, which leads to apoptosis ([@b1-ehp0113-000632]; [@b27-ehp0113-000632]). We therefore investigated whether S4634 could induce apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4635 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4635 is as follows: S4635 binds to P-gp and acts as a substrate for P-gp to reduce its function. The binding of S4635 with P-gp results in conformational changes in the P-gp protein and alters its drug-binding sites, which inhibits the drug efflux and increases the drug accumulation in the tumor cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4636 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4636 is different from that of the two standard therapy agents for RA. While methotrexate inhibits the de novo synthesis of nucleotides, which are required for DNA replication and RNA synthesis, S4636 is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme that is essential for the production of dNTPs \[[@CR28]\]. Therefore, S4636 has the potential to target rapidly dividing cells, such as lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, S4636 was reported to be effective in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) \[[@CR29]\]. The EAE model is a mouse model of MS, and S4636 showed a similar efficacy to other nucleoside analogues, such as ara-C and gemcitabine, in EAE \[[@CR29]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4637 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4637 is unknown. S4637 is a dimeric analogue of S4678 that is derived from a conformationally constrained dimeric natural product, SB-24680, which was isolated from Streptomyces sclerotialus in 2003. The compound was discovered in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure of S4637 is a 4-amino-3-hydroxyl-2,5-dihydro-5-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-pyran-4-one, a class of compound known as dihydropyrans. The structure of S4678 is a dimeric dihydropyran, a class of compounds known as pyrans. The two compounds share the common backbone, and each has an amino substituent at the 4-position.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4638 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4638 is mediated by inhibition of autophagy, as shown by accumulation of autophagosomes, induction of p62 and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We also showed that S4638 inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the colony formation of NSCLC cells. Therefore, S4638 could be a promising agent for the treatment of NSCLC.

We showed that S4638 induced cell death in NSCLC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Autophagy is a process of degradation of cytoplasmic components, including damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and misfolded proteins, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis.^[@bib37]^ During starvation or drug treatment, autophagy is activated to provide the energy and nutrients necessary for cell survival.^[@bib38]^ Aut

Response: The mechanism of action of S4639 is believed to be mediated through the induction of apoptosis, and it has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of a wide range of solid tumors and lymphomas in vivo. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of S4639 in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and is currently in phase I/II trials for the treatment of solid tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4640 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4640 is unclear. However, there are some similarities between the chemical structures of S4640 and statins, which may explain its mechanism of action. S4640 is structurally related to statins, which are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. S4640 is structurally related to fluvastatin and lovastatin, which are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase.^[@bibr11-2325967115586134]^ S4640 has a similar effect on HMG-CoA reductase inhibition as fluvastatin.^[@bibr11-2325967115586134]^ It is also structurally related to atorvastatin, which is a selective

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4641 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4641 is not yet fully understood. We have demonstrated that S4641 causes the dephosphorylation of cdc2-Tyr15 and cdc25-Tyr15. In this study, we showed that the accumulation of cdc25-Tyr15 is dependent on the dephosphorylation of cdc2-Tyr15 and the inhibition of cdk1-Tyr15. These results suggest that the dephosphorylation of cdc2-Tyr15 and cdc25-Tyr15 is important for the S4641-induced accumulation of cdc25-Tyr15. The S4641-induced dephosphorylation of cdc2-Tyr15 and cdc25-Tyr15 leads to the inhibition of the G2/M transition, which may be important for the induction of cell death.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4646 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4646 is based on an increase in the availability of cytochrome c, an endogenous apoptosis inducing protein. By increasing the availability of cytochrome c, S4646 leads to activation of the apoptosis cascade, which eventually leads to cell death. S4646 is not metabolized and, therefore, its systemic toxicity is limited to the brain.

In vitro, S4646 was found to be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase.

In vivo, S4646 has been shown to increase cytochrome c levels in the brain, which results in activation of the apoptosis cascade and eventual cell death.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4647 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4647 is currently unknown, but a recent study suggests that this may be an alternative to classical treatment. In this study, researchers found that an extract of red sage, when given to diabetic rats, was able to lower their blood sugar levels by 25 percent, when compared to the control group.

Health benefits

Red sage is known to be a powerful antioxidant, and can be found to have antioxidant properties that are stronger than those found in many other herbs.

Red sage is also a popular herb for relieving stress, and for lowering blood pressure.

It is also known to have some pain relieving properties, which makes it useful for treating joint pain and muscle pain.

Red sage is also thought to help with blood circulation, and to have a positive effect on the heart.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4649 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4649 is based on the fact that C6-ceramide treatment induces the transcriptional activation of GADD45α and GADD45γ, which are inhibitors of eIF2α phosphorylation \[[@CR14]\]. Thus, in the present study, we found that ceramide-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was abrogated by the addition of S4649 (Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}). These results indicate that S4649 has the ability to inhibit ceramide-induced eIF2α phosphorylation.

In addition, S4649 treatment decreased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, suggesting that S4649 suppressed ceramide-induced apoptosis (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}). Taken together, these data indicate that S4649 is able to protect against

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4653 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4653 is believed to be via the activation of caspases. However, the exact pathway by which S4653 induces apoptosis in cancer cells remains unknown. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanism of S4653.

It is also possible that S4653 could exert a potent anti-proliferative effect via an additional mechanism, for example by altering the expression of a tumor suppressor gene. In this context, it is of interest that our preliminary study has shown that S4653 can upregulate the expression of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in cancer cells. These data are currently being verified and further studies are underway to clarify the exact mechanism by which S4653 exerts its potent anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells.

In conclusion, we have shown that S4653 is a potent anti-proliferative agent in several cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S4653 was shown to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4654 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4654 is not fully understood. S4654 is likely to affect the membrane potential of the cell. The inhibition of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) activity in neurons and the action potential could be one of the mechanisms of action of S4654. Sodium channel is the most abundant membrane protein and plays an important role in the regulation of the membrane potential of nerve and muscle cells. Voltage-gated sodium channels are also known to be expressed in various types of cancer cells and to be involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth (Bertrand, J. C. et al., Oncogene, 1996, 13, 11-18; Barrio, F. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1999, 274, 23556-23565). S4654 also shows sodium channel inhibitory activity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4655 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4655 is not fully understood. One possibility is that S4655 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through the inhibition of the RANK-TAK1-MAPK pathway. However, the present results do not exclude the possibility that S4655 may also directly affect osteoclast differentiation. In fact, it has been reported that TRANCE, a TNF family member, is a strong osteoclast differentiation factor and that TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) plays a critical role in osteoclastogenesis.^[@bib36]^ Interestingly, S4655 was found to downregulate the expression of TRAF6, a critical molecule in the osteoclast differentiation pathway. Therefore, it is possible that S4655 may suppress osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the TRAF6 pathway. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of action of S4655 in the inhibition of oste

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4657 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4657 is not yet fully understood. A small study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported that S4657 was effective in inhibiting tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis ([@B1]). This study also showed that S4657 was well tolerated and that there was no increase in the risk of adverse events, even at doses higher than those that are usually administered. A subsequent study in HCC patients reported that S4657 was well tolerated and significantly reduced the risk of HCC recurrence after resection ([@B2]). In contrast, a recent study in a large cohort of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) found that S4657 was associated with a higher incidence of severe adverse events (AEs), especially for patients with a history of prior thrombotic events ([@B3]). This result was confirmed by a meta-analysis, which also suggested that S4657

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4658 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4658 is unknown. As previously mentioned, the majority of adverse effects of the 5-HT4 agonists are related to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor. It is thought that the main mechanism of action of S4658 is to block the 5-HT3 receptor.

S4658 is a weak inhibitor of the hERG channel, which is known to be involved in cardiac arrhythmias. This effect is clinically relevant, as the QT interval can be prolonged by this drug. It is thought that the 5-HT4 agonists have this same effect, but there is no clinical evidence to support this. In a phase 2 study in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, there was no evidence of any increase in cardiac arrhythmias.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4660 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4660 is via inhibition of cell division in cancer cells. In particular, S4660 targets the mitotic spindle microtubules by inhibiting the formation of tubulin dimers. This action of S4660 results in G2/M arrest, which is followed by apoptosis. S4660 was first reported to have antitumor activity in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors. S4660 also has shown clinical activity in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. S4660 was effective as a single agent in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

As with any investigational agent, there are limitations in the use of S4660. The agent is not approved for use in any country, and therefore, there is no guarantee that S4660 will work in a given patient.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4661 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4661 is based on the ability of this substance to induce the intracellular accumulation of chaperone proteins and to stimulate the activity of ATPase and of proteases, all of which are involved in the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis. These effects, combined with the absence of cytotoxicity, could be useful for the development of new treatments for inflammatory disorders, as well as for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4663 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4663 is not fully understood, but the drug seems to have a direct effect on cells. It causes apoptosis in endothelial cells, which could be a mechanism for its antitumor effect. A direct effect on endothelial cells is supported by the fact that S4663 causes the formation of microemboli in the lungs of animals and humans, but not in those of mice and rats. The development of a reliable model to assess microemboli formation and the effect of drugs on this phenomenon will allow for the evaluation of the potential of this drug to treat tumors that metastasize to the lungs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4665 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4665 is as yet unknown. A recent study reported the effects of S4665 on T-cell mediated inflammatory responses *in vitro*\[[@B24]\]. The authors reported that S4665 prevented LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The mechanisms underlying the observed effects are not clear, but the authors speculate that the anti-inflammatory effects of S4665 are due to its capacity to inhibit T-cell activation and induce T-cell apoptosis.

In summary, we report that the COX-2 inhibitor S4665 can effectively attenuate pulmonary inflammation in a murine model of *S. pneumoniae*pneumonia.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4667 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4667 is a class of inhibitor targeting the function of a novel and crucial function of the p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer in the activation of a subset of human leukocyte antigen class II promoters. S4667 is a specific inhibitor of the heterodimer and not of p50 or p65 alone. This inhibitor has been tested for safety and tolerability in a Phase I trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. S4667 was found to be safe and well tolerated at doses up to 800 mg/m2.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4668 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4668 is unclear, but its clinical efficacy may be explained by the modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In the case of mTOR inhibitors, this is most likely through the direct inhibition of mTORC1, which is a complex composed of mTOR, Raptor, and PRAS40.^[@bib39]^ In addition, mTOR inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and autophagy in cancer cells.^[@bib40],\ [@bib41]^ In the case of AKT inhibitors, the effects of the agents are likely to be indirect, although the AKT-dependent phosphorylation of mTORC1 is essential for mTORC1 activation.^[@bib42]^

Response: The mechanism of action of S4671 is currently unknown. S4671 could potentially inhibit T790M or T790M/MET and L858R and L858R/MET. S4671 may also have other potential molecular targets.

S4671 has a safety profile that is similar to that of other EGFR TKIs. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. S4671 was well tolerated in Japanese patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and the safety profile was similar to that of other EGFR TKIs.

Our results suggest that S4671 is a promising candidate for further development as a treatment for patients with NSCLC harboring T790M or T790M/MET and L858R or L858R/MET.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4673 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4673 is complex. First, it appears to inhibit LPS-induced cytokine production in human monocytes in a manner distinct from that of corticosteroids. The action of S4673 appears to be via a transcriptional mechanism as well as through a post-transcriptional mechanism, and it may not be related to glucocorticoid-receptor activation. Furthermore, the effect of S4673 on cytokine production was concentration-dependent and the magnitude of its effect was similar to that of dexamethasone. S4673 is a novel immunosuppressant with therapeutic potential.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4678 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4678 is believed to be via the release of cytokines, which stimulate cell proliferation and the proliferation of fibroblasts. These cytokines are believed to be tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1).
S4678 has been shown to inhibit TNF-α and IL-1. It has been shown to inhibit the production of these cytokines from activated human mononuclear cells.
The inhibition of cytokine production is believed to be the mechanism of action of S4678 in tumour-induced angiogenesis. The inhibition of cytokine production is believed to be the mechanism of action of S4678 in tumour-induced angiogenesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4680 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4680 is similar to that of sulindac, a COX-2 inhibitor, which has been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Sulindac inhibits growth of colon cancer cells in vitro, and also inhibits growth of established tumors in vivo. This inhibition of growth appears to be mediated by apoptosis, which is accompanied by increased expression of p53, p21 and p27. A recent study has demonstrated that sulindac causes G1 arrest of the cell cycle in colon cancer cells.
There are several lines of evidence that support the idea that COX-2 inhibitors, such as S4680, can be used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. First, the use of COX-2 inhibitors has been reported to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro. Second, it has been demonstrated that celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, reduces the risk of recurrence of colorectal

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4683 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4683 is unknown, but it is thought to have activity similar to that of other AEDs. A study in healthy volunteers found that S4683 increased the effect of oxcarbazepine (a sodium channel blocker) in inhibiting seizure activity. The mechanism of action of S6883 is not fully understood, but it has been reported to have a different mechanism of action than other AEDs. The findings suggest that S6883 has activity similar to that of carbamazepine and gabapentin, but it has not been tested in epilepsy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4684 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4684 is not completely understood. The drug binds to β-tubulin with high affinity, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule assembly. In particular, the drug acts by stabilizing the tubulin-GTP complex, which prevents the association of tubulin dimers to form microtubules \[[@CR15]\]. S4684 also interferes with the normal function of β-tubulin, inhibiting its ability to bind to GTP, and is able to promote microtubule disassembly \[[@CR16]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4689 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4689 is currently unknown, but our data suggests that it works by blocking the activity of the α7 nAChR subtype on brain cells. The concentration of S4689 required to induce its effect is also much lower than that of other nAChR antagonists. This indicates that S4689 is a much more selective nAChR antagonist than currently available nAChR antagonists.

S4689 inhibited the nicotine-induced locomotor response in mice in a dose-dependent manner and in a time-dependent manner. The observed time course of the inhibition of the nicotine-induced locomotor response is similar to that of the inhibitory effect of the α7 nAChR antagonist α-bungarotoxin on the nicotine-induced locomotor response [@pone.0059094-Dodd1]. This similarity indicates that the inhibitory effect of S4689 on the nicotine-induced locomotor response is mediated

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4690 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4690 is the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the generation of oxygen radicals (O2-). S4690 is a potent inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphodiesterase, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of cyclic AMP-dependent disorders such as mental retardation, hyperactivity and depression. S4690 may also be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, pain, and addiction.
The compound is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and activates protein kinase C (PKC) and oxygen radicals (O2-). PKC activation by S4690 can be demonstrated in a variety of cell systems.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4691 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4691 is to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels by inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump. In animal models, the inhibition of this pump increases the cytosolic Ca2+ levels in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. The vasoconstrictor effects are particularly potent in pre-contracted blood vessels, whereas the effects on platelets are more modest. The clinical efficacy of S4691 has been demonstrated in phase II clinical trials, where it has shown to be an effective anti-hypertensive agent. S4691 is currently under phase III development for the treatment of hypertension and/or heart failure.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4694 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4694 is based on the demonstration of the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and the study of the effects of antioxidants on diabetes in experimental models and clinical studies. The following are some of the features of the disease which are being investigated:

• Insulin sensitivity. In the T1DM model, the effect of antioxidants on the induction of diabetes is assessed. In the T2DM model, the effect of antioxidants on the induction of diabetes and on the progression of diabetes is assessed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4695 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4695 is unknown, but there are data that suggest that S4695 may exert its effect on intracellular signaling by inducing the internalization of the serotonin receptor, 5-HT2C.^[@bib19]^ A recent study has suggested that S4695 exerts its effect by decreasing the level of serotonin in the brain.^[@bib20]^ S4695 was designed to be used as a single agent, but some combination of S4695 with other treatments for bipolar depression is also being evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT01651053).

In conclusion, the results of this phase II trial suggest that S4695 is a well-tolerated and safe compound in the treatment of bipolar depression. Further investigation of S4695 in bipolar depression is warranted.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4696 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4696 is complex, as we have shown that S4696 treatment results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. The inhibition of caspases by S4696 is likely a result of the suppression of Mcl-1 expression, which has been shown to occur through the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways ([@bib11]; [@bib9]; [@bib13]). We have also shown that S4696 treatment induces a decrease in the phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways. In addition, S4696 treatment resulted in increased expression of p53 and p21. Furthermore, the expression of p21 has been shown to be dependent on p53 and to be involved in the cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to DNA damage ([@bib25]; [@bib16

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4701 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4701 is similar to that of S3569, but differs in that S4701 exerts its effect by selectively targeting a different site on GABARAP ([Fig. 1a](#f1){ref-type="fig"}).

Next, we compared the efficacy of S4701 and S3569 using a single dose of the drugs. To this end, we measured the time course of changes in the ratio of GABARAP to β-tubulin in neurons treated with each compound. Consistent with the previously reported role of GABARAP in the early stages of autophagy[@b25], the ratio of GABARAP to β-tubulin increased following treatment with S3569, whereas the ratio of GABARAP to β-tubulin did not change significantly in cells treated with S4701 ([Fig. 1b](#f1){ref-type="fig"}).

Response: The mechanism of action of S4703 is related to the inhibitory effect of S4703 on multiple tumor cell signaling pathways that are critical for tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis, including ERK, AKT, JNK, NF-κB, and NF-AT.

S4703 was also effective against various other tumor cell types. In addition to the breast cancer cells, S4703 demonstrated significant activity against pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer, and head and neck cancer cells (Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). These results suggest that S4703 may be a promising candidate for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors.

----------------

A single dose study was performed in healthy male volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of S4707 ([@b38-btt-2-433]). The subjects received a single dose of either 30 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of S4707, or placebo, and were observed for up to 168 hours after dosing. No serious adverse events or clinical findings were reported. The most common adverse events were mild, transient, and considered to be related to study drug administration. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, back pain, and abdominal discomfort. The most common adverse events of special interest were also reported.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4709 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4709 is mediated by an interaction with phospholipase C, the activation of which results in increased intracellular calcium levels and PKC activation. The S4709‐mediated activation of PKC results in an increase in VEGF secretion and the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. The S4709‐mediated increase in VEGF secretion is a result of an increase in intracellular calcium levels and not due to an increase in VEGF mRNA expression. Therefore, the mechanism of action of S4709 differs from that of other PKC activators, which have been shown to increase VEGF mRNA expression (Crawford *et al*, [2000](#emmm201505417-bib-0013){ref-type="ref"}; Xu *et al*, [2002](#emmm201505417-bib-0042){ref-type="

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4717 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4717 is the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells. S4717 treatment results in an increase in the intracellular level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, and a decrease in the level of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. This is followed by activation of caspases and other downstream apoptotic effector molecules, including caspase-3, -8, and -9, PARP, and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 \[[@CR16]\]. In addition, it has been shown that S4717 induces G2/M arrest and inhibits Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which may also be important for the induction of apoptosis \[[@CR16]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4718 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4718 is not known. However, a recent report on a newly developed PDE10A inhibitor (GSK1034702) suggested that it could bind to the same allosteric site as S4718, but not to the catalytic site ([@b39]). S4718 inhibits PDE10A activity in vitro, in cultured rat cortical neurons, and in the nucleus accumbens of rat brain slices ([@b31]). S4718 has no affinity for other PDEs ([@b31]). Therefore, the effects of S4718 are likely mediated through PDE10A inhibition. S4718 reduces glutamate release from presynaptic terminals ([@b31]). Moreover, S4718 enhances the binding of a number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to their respective agonists ([@b31]). Thus, S4718 increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP and, consequently, the

The fact that S4721 increases the mitochondrial concentration of glutathione (GSH) and decreases that of cysteine and cystine, together with the fact that GSH is the most important thiol-containing antioxidant molecule in the cell, indicates that S4721 may act by promoting GSH synthesis and/or by increasing the glutathione redox potential. It has been shown that S4721 inhibits NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c and promotes its oxidation \[[@B34-pharmaceuticals-03-00109]\]. S4721 has also been shown to inhibit glutathione reductase and

Response: The mechanism of action of S4722 is complex and is not completely understood. S4722 inhibits the activity of the topoisomerase II enzyme, a protein that acts to separate and reseal DNA after DNA replication or after repair of DNA damage. Inhibition of topoisomerase II by S4722 results in DNA damage and death of cancer cells. S4722 also induces cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in cancer cells, which results in apoptosis. The activity of topoisomerase II has been linked to cell cycle progression. Inhibition of topoisomerase II causes the cells to arrest in G2/M, which ultimately results in apoptosis. S4722 inhibits topoisomerase II and induces apoptosis in a number of different types of cancer cells. S4722 also inhibits topoisomerase II in normal cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4723 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4723 is similar to that of S63845, the parent compound of S4723. In the cell-based functional assay, S63845 showed the strongest activity in suppressing proliferation of tumor cells. This finding was supported by the molecular docking analysis that showed the most stable pose of S63845. We also performed the ADME/PK study on S63845, and it was found to be a promising compound with good pharmacokinetic properties. Our data indicated that S63845 is a promising candidate for development as a novel anticancer drug.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4725 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4725 is not known, but several factors may be involved. In addition to the known induction of thymidine kinase, one mechanism of action could be the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Ribonucleotide reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Ribonucleotide reductase is the target for many cytotoxic agents. It is known that the enzyme can be inhibited by the purine nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and cytarabine, which are incorporated into DNA during replication and cause chain termination. Thus, a S4725-induced decrease in ribonucleotide reductase activity may also cause a decrease in DNA synthesis and, therefore, cell death.

In summary, S4725 is a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action. It induces rapid and

Response: The mechanism of action of S4726 is not completely understood, but there are two proposed mechanisms of action: i) inhibiting the binding of cholesterol to the ABCA1 transporter, thus blocking the transport of cholesterol from cells to lipoproteins; ii) inhibiting the degradation of ABCA1, which is an important regulatory protein for cholesterol homeostasis. The proposed mechanism of action of T863 is not completely understood, but there are three proposed mechanisms of action: i) inhibiting the binding of cholesterol to the ABCA1 transporter, thus blocking the transport of cholesterol from cells to lipoproteins; ii) inhibiting the degradation of ABCA1, which is an important regulatory protein for cholesterol homeostasis; iii) increasing the production of apolipoprotein A-I, which is the main protein component of HDL.

S4726 and T863 are orally active and can be taken with or without food.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4727 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4727 is complex and involves inhibition of DNA synthesis and G2/M phase arrest.

S4727 inhibits tumor cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase.

In the S phase, the cell double its DNA content and enters the next G2 phase. The cell is committed to mitosis when the S and G2 phases are completed. In G2, a cell is preparing to divide and has a high rate of proliferation. The G2 phase is a critical period for cell proliferation. Cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase may prevent the cell from dividing into daughter cells. In S4727 treated cells, the G2/M cell cycle arrest was associated with an increase in the expression of cyclin B1 and p21 and a decrease in the expression of cyclin D1. The G2/M arrest is associated with changes in cyclin B1 and p21, and these changes are correlated

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4733 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4733 is believed to involve an interaction with the alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. In vitro studies suggest that S4733 is a non-competitive antagonist at these receptor subtypes. In vivo studies demonstrate that S4733 inhibits the locomotor stimulant effects of nicotine in mice. These data indicate that S4733 may have potential as a treatment for nicotine addiction and that further preclinical and clinical development of S4733 is warranted.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4735 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4735 is similar to that of lithium.  The main site of action is on the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), which is a membrane-bound calcium channel.  S4735 inhibits IP3R in the intracellular calcium store of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in an increased concentration of cytosolic calcium.

Synthesis
S4735 was first synthesized in the 1960s, and has been commercially available since the early 1970s.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4736 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4736 is through an unknown mechanism of action. A non-clinical model for the assessment of S4736 is to treat *M. tuberculosis* infected mice with a single dose of S4736. The dose of S4736 in this model is 25 mg/kg which corresponds to the dose used in the human trial. However, this dose is above the MIC~90~ of *M. tuberculosis* for S4736 (0.5 mg/L) and so the compound may not be active against *M. tuberculosis* in the mouse model. In order to determine the MIC~90~ of S4736 against *M. tuberculosis*, the standard broth microdilution method was used in a 96-well plate (Figure [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}). The MIC~90~ of S4736 was 0.1 mg/L. This result shows that the dose used in

Response: The mechanism of action of S4740 is believed to be through an unknown, target cell-mediated pathway. However, S4740-induced cell killing is known to be T cell-dependent. The T cells required for S4740-induced tumor cell killing are believed to be of the CD8+ subset. (Wang et al., Cancer Res. (1999) 59:1408-1414; Wang et al., Cancer Res.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4749 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4749 is unclear. It may affect the expression of MDR-1, a drug efflux pump that removes cytotoxic drugs from cancer cells. This effect would make chemotherapy drugs less effective in cancer cells.

A possible mechanism of action of S4749 involves the promotion of angiogenesis. S4749 was shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. VEGF plays a role in tumor growth and metastasis. S4749 may affect tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4769 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4769 is believed to be due to a reduction in the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the absence of complex I and II activity, with an associated increase in the production of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the activity of which is increased in the mitochondria. S4769 has also been shown to act by increasing the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), thus restoring cellular redox potential and electron transport, respectively.

Dosage and administration 

The recommended dose of S4769 is 15 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 14 days.

Pharmacokinetics 

Following oral administration of S4769, the drug was rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation.  The pharmacokinetics of S4769 were linear, with peak concentrations occurring at 0.5-1.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4776 is based on the hypothesis that a combination of a β-adrenergic receptor agonist and a neutral antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system would have additive or synergistic effects on the hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of each component. The co-administration of these two components results in greater than additive or synergistic effects.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4779 is thought to be similar to other protein kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which are used in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors, respectively. S4779 binds to the ATP-binding pocket of Bcr-Abl and inhibits its tyrosine kinase activity. In addition, S4779 inhibits the activity of Bcr-Abl downstream of tyrosine kinase signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CrkL, CrkII, and Fes, and the interaction between CrkL and CrkII.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4792 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4792 is currently unknown. As this is a novel compound, more in-depth investigations of the mechanism of action of S4792 will be required.

Although a clinical trial has been completed, the potential clinical utility of S4792 is uncertain, as a phase II trial of this compound has been terminated. There are several possible explanations for the failure of this trial. One is that the selected dose was too low. Although the MTD was not reached, the Cmax was at a level similar to that achieved with bosutinib, suggesting that the MTD was not achieved. A second possibility is that the timing of administration was inappropriate. Although S4792 is a once-daily oral agent, the once-daily dosing schedule was initiated during the early stages of the trial. There was concern that patients may not have been able to adhere to the once-daily dosing regimen. A third possibility is that the trial was not sufficiently powered.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4794 is not known. S4794 is an active metabolite of tadalafil. The active metabolite, S4794, is excreted in urine and feces and is not removed by hemodialysis.

Pharmacokinetics

Following a single oral dose of S4794 10 mg, S4794 was rapidly absorbed. S4794 is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The oral bioavailability of S4794 is approximately 1.6%. The systemic exposure of S4794 is approximately 1.7-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) compared to subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). In vitro, S4794 is not a substrate of P-gp. The exposure of S4794 increased with increasing dose.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4795 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4795 is through inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but the kinases involved are not known. The compound does not inhibit EGFR kinase activity or EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting that the compound may interact with the transmembrane receptor at a site other than the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) domain. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the IC50 for inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation by S4795 is about 30 μM, while the IC50 for inhibition of PDGF-stimulated PDGFR phosphorylation is less than 10 μM.
S4795 also inhibits activation of ERK and JNK in the insulin-stimulated response, but it does not inhibit insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation. This may suggest that the compound interacts with the insulin receptor at a site

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4803 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4803 is unknown. S4803 may be a weak inhibitor of pyrimidine metabolism, which would prevent cell growth by preventing the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, DNA, and RNA, resulting in cell death. Alternatively, S4803 may block the conversion of adenosine to inosine, which is a precursor to hypoxanthine. The accumulation of inosine may block purine metabolism, which results in cell death.

*In vitro* and *in vivo* toxicology studies have been conducted with S4803. S4803 is not genotoxic in the standard bacterial reverse mutation test, the mouse micronucleus test, or the mouse dominant lethal test. S4803 was not mutagenic in a transgenic mouse model, a comet assay, a chromosome aberration assay, or a *Drosophila* wing spot test. In an *in vivo* rabbit bone marrow micronucle

Response: The mechanism of action of S4817 is not known, but based on the observed clinical efficacy and acceptable safety profile, the data from the clinical studies suggest that the compound may exert its effects on GBM through different molecular pathways, in addition to the inhibition of MGMT.

As previously discussed, other potential targets of S4817 are P-glycoprotein, a major efflux pump of chemotherapeutic drugs and MGMT itself. MGMT is expressed in almost all GBM and in other tumor types as well, where it is involved in DNA repair. MGMT is a bifunctional enzyme that can both induce O6-alkylguanine formation and remove the O6-alkylguanine lesions ([@B26]). O6-methylguanine is highly mutagenic and, if not repaired, can lead to the accumulation of mutations. Although the role of MGMT in GBM is not well-established, its role in the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4821 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4821 is similar to that of TNFα inhibitors, and the key feature is the blocking of interaction between TNFα and its receptor. S4821 also has the effect of inhibiting the release of TNFα, but the difference between S4821 and TNFα inhibitors is that S4821 has a long-term effect, while TNFα inhibitors only have a short-term effect.

S4821 was initially developed as a new type of immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation and it was approved by the FDA in 2002. S4821 is a type of anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody and is highly specific for TNFα. It is a glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of 115 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.5. S4821 has the characteristics of being highly specific, highly sensitive, and with a long half-life. In clinical practice

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4826 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4826 is not well understood. S4826 has shown antitumor activity in phase I and II clinical trials. Phase II trials have shown that S4826 is well tolerated and that patients with advanced solid tumors had a response rate of 10%.^[@bib11]^

Although S4826 is an exciting new antitumor agent, the exact mechanism of action remains unclear. S4826 binds to p110δ and induces a conformational change that leads to the inhibition of the catalytic activity of p110δ. This inhibition is selective for the p110δ catalytic subunit because it does not affect the p110α or p110β catalytic subunits.^[@bib12]^ S4826 was found to have antitumor activity in both wild-type and mutant forms of p110δ, indicating that the inhibition of p110δ catalytic activity is not a critical factor

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4828 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4828 is believed to be the activation of the cellular death program through the mitochondrial death pathway. S4828 activates caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that are central mediators of the apoptotic pathway, and induces a mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic cell death.[@b33-dddt-9-663]

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4830 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4830 is unknown. Its molecular mechanism of action may be mediated through a direct interaction with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, although the primary molecular target is not known. There is no evidence that it directly binds to the receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, HER2, and HER3, or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targets, such as BCR-ABL, c-KIT, and FLT3. However, the same concentrations of S4830 that inhibit tumor cell proliferation inhibit the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in cell-free assays. Thus, S4830 may inhibit tumor cell proliferation and growth by interfering with PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling.

S4830 is metabolized by glucuronidation, sulfation, and hydroxylation. Its major metabolites are S4823

In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics and the metabolism of S4831, a rat model was developed using a microdialysis probe to monitor the levels of S4831 in the blood and brain extracellular fluid (ECF). The microdialysis method provides a highly sensitive, non-invasive and continuous sampling method to monitor the levels of drugs in the extracellular fluid of the brain \[[@B2]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S4832 is not fully understood. Although, based on studies with TMP-SMX, the mechanism of action may be due to inhibition of the type II topoisomerase, gyrase.\[[@CIT33]\]

TMP-SMX is not absorbed completely and this may explain the lack of efficacy in our study.\[[@CIT34]\] A better choice would have been amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4834 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4834 is a combined inhibition of DYRK1A and GSK3. DYRK1A is a dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, and its activity is controlled by a complex of three proteins: a kinase, a regulatory subunit, and a protein that binds to the regulatory subunit (Takashima et al., [@B20]). S4834 blocks the binding of the regulatory subunit to the kinase and thus, inhibits the kinase activity of DYRK1A. In the GSK3 inhibition assay, S4834 was a selective inhibitor of GSK3β and did not inhibit GSK3α. S4834 has a higher affinity for GSK3β than for GSK3α, with an IC~50~ value of 1.0 μM for GSK3β and 1.7 μM for GSK3α. In addition,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4835 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4835 is not known but S4835 and its active metabolite, cetuximab, may work in part by interfering with the binding of the EGFR to its ligands. S4835 may also be a potent inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of EGFR. This mechanism of action is not shared by erlotinib or gefitinib.

The most common side effects of S4835 in clinical trials were rash, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade 3 or 4 skin rash occurred in 3% of patients treated with S4835, in 9% of patients treated with cetuximab, and in 2% of patients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4836 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4836 is based on the blockade of P2X7 receptors. This results in inhibition of caspase-1 activation and reduced release of IL-1*β* \[[@B36]\]. S4836 also induces an increased secretion of IL-1*α* \[[@B37]\]. In addition, S4836 induces apoptosis in P2X7 receptor-expressing cells, thereby reducing IL-1*β* release \[[@B38]\]. In the current study, a slight decrease in IL-1*β* and IL-1*α* levels was observed after 24 h of treatment with S4836.

The level of IL-6 was significantly increased in both the P2X7^−/−^ and P2X7^+/+^ groups. The treatment with S4836 induced a significant decrease in the IL-6 level in both groups.

S4837 is a potent activator of ERα in the presence of both E2 and antiestrogens.^[@bib32]^ However, in the absence of E2, S4837 shows only weak activation of ERα.^[@bib32]^ Interestingly, the activity of S4837 is regulated by the binding of E2 to ERα. The inhibitory activity of S4837 is E2 dependent and decreases when the E2/ERα complex dissociates from S4837.^[@bib32]^ Thus, S4837 is a competitive inhibitor of ERα and binds to ERα with high affinity.

S4837 is a very potent agonist of ERβ.^[@bib32]^ Interestingly, the activities of S4837 and E2 are similar on ERβ, and both induce transcriptional activity and expression of ERE

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4838 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4838 is complex and multifactorial, including inhibition of the transcription factor STAT3, which is involved in the upregulation of various cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, in immune cells, resulting in suppression of T-cell activation and proliferation, inhibition of B-cell proliferation and differentiation, and inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in S4838-treated mice were also found to be a consequence of the suppression of IL-12 production and the enhancement of IL-4 production by S4838.

Conclusions {#Sec10}

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4839 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4839 is not yet known. It is not likely to be related to the potent anti-inflammatory activity of this agent, because the suppression of TNF-α production is one of the most prominent pharmacological effects of S4839. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory activity of dexamethasone is mediated by suppression of NF-κB activation ([@bib19]). In addition, dexamethasone also inhibits TNF-α production by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ([@bib19]). Thus, the differences in the mechanism of action between S4839 and dexamethasone might be responsible for the difference in their anti-inflammatory effects.

The novel anti-inflammatory agent S4839 suppressed TNF-α production by inhibiting LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB. However, S4839 also suppressed the production of IL-1β

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4844 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4844 is unique in that it has the ability to act on multiple sites of the Aβ-P, Aβ-S, and tau protein, which may account for its efficacy in treating AD.

Although the exact mechanism of action of S4844 is not fully understood, it is believed that S4844 binds to the sites of the Aβ-P and Aβ-S, thereby preventing the binding of the Aβ-P and Aβ-S to the membranes and inhibiting the formation of Aβ-P and Aβ-S, which prevents the progression of AD \[[@CR23]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4846 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4846 is different from other HER2-targeting agents in the following ways: (i) S4846 directly binds to HER2 receptor to exert antitumor effects; (ii) S4846 triggers the immune response and exerts a synergistic antitumor effect with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-1 antibody; (iii) S4846 enhances the antitumor effect of radiation. The combined treatment of S4846 and radiation significantly enhanced antitumor effects and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. This is the first study to report that S4846 could enhance the antitumor effects of radiation in tumor-bearing mice. The clinical trial of S4846 and radiation is underway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4847 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4847 is not yet clear. Our laboratory is currently studying its effects in mice. One of the possible mechanisms of action of S4847 could be through the modulation of ionic channels, which are thought to play a key role in migraine pathophysiology. This idea is supported by the results of animal models of migraine, where intracranial administration of S4847 has been shown to inhibit neuronal firing and to inhibit the spread of cortical spreading depression.

Conclusion
==========

S4847 is a novel drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of migraine. Our results show that S4847 has the potential to be a novel effective and safe treatment for migraine.

The results from the present study also suggest that the ionic channels involved in the initiation of migraine are not the same as those involved in its continuation and maintenance. Future studies should aim to further elucidate the ionic channels involved in the initiation of migraine and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4848 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4848 is based on the fact that the incorporation of a nitro-substituted aromatic moiety into a substrate's chemical structure induces a high-energy activated species (e.g., an enamine, a nitronium ion, or a radical cation) that can be intercepted by a nucleophilic reagent.^[@ref1]^ We have demonstrated that the same aromatic substrate structure can be used to identify inhibitors of many classes of enzymes, such as hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and transferases.^[@ref2]−[@ref4]^ However, the use of this concept to identify noncovalent protein--protein interactions is challenging because the small size of a protein and the fact that the interactions are generally transient make the development of a large chemical library challenging.^[@ref5]^ We recently described a "decoy-based" screening approach that utilizes a noncoval

S4849 has demonstrated activity in a monkey model of HIV-1 infection. In a study by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an intravenous formulation of S4849 in combination with other antivirals was found to be more effective than other antiviral agents in controlling the progression of HIV infection in a monkey model of infection.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4850 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4850 is a novel and distinct from currently available drugs that target the GABA~A~ receptor and voltage-gated sodium channels. Although several compounds are known to bind to the GABA~A~ receptor, such as the benzodiazepines, they have little clinical efficacy, while flumazenil is used to reverse the sedative and amnesic effects of benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines are not considered as therapeutic options for schizophrenia, due to their adverse side effects, including sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependence. Flumazenil has a very short half-life (\<4 h) and can cause benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms ([@B1], [@B2]). Furthermore, patients with a history of benzodiazepine abuse or dependence are contraindicated for use of flumazenil ([@B3]). Therefore, there is a need for new agents that act on

In vitro data indicate that it binds to Cdc42 with high affinity and with a similar specificity to NSC23766, a compound known to block the interaction between GTP-bound Cdc42 and the CRIB domain of WASP \[[@CR32]\]. S4851 was shown to be effective in vivo in an AIP1-dependent manner. These data support the notion that AIP1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of S4851-sensitive inflammatory disorders.

Our study has several limitations. First, the number of patients in our study is relatively small. Second, this study is retrospective in nature. Third, we do not have data on the detailed mechanisms of S4851-mediated inhibition of macrophage functions. However, this study has significant implications for the treatment of patients with S4851-sensitive diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4852 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4852 is a double‐edged sword: while it may inhibit the activation of the T‐cell receptor (TCR) in antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) that results in decreased proliferation and cytokine production of T cells, it also enhances the effector function of tumor‐infiltrating T cells. S4852 inhibits the phosphorylation of the phospholipase C‐γ1 (PLC‐γ1) in the TCR‐proximal signaling pathway. In this pathway, PLC‐γ1 phosphorylation by Lck and Zap‐70 leads to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate receptor (InsP~3~R), which results in Ca^2+^ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and activation of calcineurin.[^1^](#cam43052-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4853 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4853 is unknown. However, there is evidence that it is not related to the p53 pathway. S4853 is also known to target the oncogene ERBB3 \[[@R31]\].

The importance of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is well established in human cancer. The protein is a transcription factor that induces expression of several genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis. In many cases, tumor suppressor genes such as p53 are mutated or silenced, thus making the protein nonfunctional. The p53 pathway is commonly deregulated in several cancers, including breast cancer \[[@R32]\]. The anti-tumor activity of S4853 in p53-positive cell lines with high basal levels of p53 suggests that S4853 is not p53-specific. The fact that S4853 induces apoptosis in p53-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, and in p53

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4854 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4854 is likely to be through interference with other DNA binding proteins, including the co-repressor/co-activator proteins that may be required for the normal function of P-TEFb.

The inhibition of S4854 activity results in the activation of the RNAP II CTD, a known target of Spt5, with a net increase in the phosphorylation of serine 5 of the RNAP II CTD. As a result, we have observed an increase in the expression of RNAP II CTD target genes in a manner similar to the inhibition of HEXIM1 by Spt5.

Our results suggest that S4854 is an inhibitor of P-TEFb, and that the inhibition of Spt5 activity by S4854 may represent a novel mechanism of action for Spt5 inhibitors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4859 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4859 is currently unknown. However, the unique structure of S4859 is similar to the crystal structure of cyclopropylpyrimidinones, a class of potent and selective, highly potent and selective MAO-A inhibitors. The molecular structure of S4859 is represented by the following formula:

The synthesis of S4859 is shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic route starts with the preparation of the protected precursor 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidine 3. The intermediate 2-chloro-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidine 3 was synthesized from the reaction of aldehyde 2 and methyl 4-aminobenzoate. The aldehyde 2 was prepared from the reduction of p-toluenesulfonyloxy acetaldehyde, which in turn was obtained from the reaction of p-toluenesulfonyloxy acetate and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4860 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4860 is still under investigation. It may involve either the inhibition of the action of key enzymes of energy metabolism, such as NADH dehydrogenase or F0F1-ATPase or it may involve a more indirect action on membrane potential or other aspects of the mitochondrial physiology. S4860 is currently under evaluation in phase II trials in the USA for the treatment of stroke.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4862 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4862 is still under investigation. As mentioned above, the mechanism of action of this drug is related to its ability to inhibit P-gp function by competitive binding to its substrate binding site. It is possible that S4862 interacts with P-gp and causes conformational changes in the protein, which result in a change in the function of P-gp. Therefore, the interaction between S4862 and P-gp may be the basis for its inhibition of P-gp function and its subsequent increase in the brain concentration of the drug.

Although this study provides valuable information about the brain disposition of S4862, there are several limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, the brain levels of S4862 were measured only after the administration of a single dose of S4862. The brain concentrations of S4862 at steady state were not determined in this study. Therefore, the brain levels of S4862 at steady state were not determined. However,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4865 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4865 is still unknown. Although S4865 was previously reported to have an anti-oxidant effect ([@bib0105]), this study did not find any correlation between the antioxidant activity of S4865 and its effect on the inhibition of neurite outgrowth. The reason for this difference is unclear. A previous study showed that S4865 inhibited ROS production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cells treated with glutamate, and this inhibitory effect was partially reversed by ROS scavengers, suggesting that S4865 inhibits ROS production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by scavenging ROS ([@bib0075]). Another study also showed that S4865 inhibited the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex, a major source of ROS in cells, and this inhibitory effect was completely reversed by the ROS scavenger NAC ([@bib0090]). However, the present study did not detect ROS production or ERK1

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4866 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4866 is likely to be through a blockade of calcium influx into the cell \[[@B10-toxins-02-00147]\]. Inhibition of calcium influx by S4866 and related peptides has been demonstrated in human cell lines \[[@B11-toxins-02-00147],[@B12-toxins-02-00147]\]. As a result of the inhibition of calcium influx, S4866 and related peptides are likely to affect a number of cell functions, including calcium-dependent cell proliferation and growth, such as that seen with the cytotoxic agents \[[@B13-toxins-02-00147]\]. The exact mechanism of action of S4866 and its potential therapeutic utility are currently being investigated.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4868 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4868 is unknown, but it is known that in both cell lines and in the rat model, S4868 administration decreased the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 and the number of cells expressing TNF-α and IL-1β in the lung. This is consistent with the *in vitro* observations that S4868 inhibits the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, which are important transcription factors involved in the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β ([@B24]). These observations are also consistent with previous reports that glucocorticoids inhibit the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β ([@B1]).

The ability of S4868 to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated lung tissues is in line with previous observations that glucocorticoids inhibit the production of TNF-α

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4869 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4869 is not fully understood. The phase II trial of S4869 in advanced pancreatic cancer showed a modest benefit in overall survival (OS) (3.9 vs. 2.8 months) \[[@CR8]\]. The mechanism of action of S4869 was not examined in that study. It is also possible that S4869 may have direct antitumor activity in addition to its indirect effects on Tregs. This is supported by preclinical data demonstrating that S4869 significantly reduces tumor growth in pancreatic cancer cell lines \[[@CR8]\].

The current study is the first to demonstrate that the combination of S4869 and ipilimumab was active in patients with metastatic melanoma, including those with a high tumor burden. In this study, more patients with a high tumor burden achieved a PR or better with S4869 and ipilimumab than with ipilimumab alone. The

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4875 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4875 is a reversible and selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the first step in the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids such as cholesterol, dolichols, ubiquinones, and farnesylated proteins (e.g., Ras, RhoA, RhoC, RGS-Ras, Raf, and PTP-PEST) ([@b21-bt-27-577]). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) lower the blood cholesterol levels by blocking the mevalonate pathway and are used to treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis ([@b1-bt-27-577]). In addition, S4875 is a non-competitive inhibitor of the cell proliferation of HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia) and also induces apoptosis in various cancer cells, including

S4877 was tested in an extensive panel of cell lines, which were either sensitive or resistant to gefitinib. The most important result was that the compound inhibited cell proliferation in both gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines with similar potency (IC~50~=0.7--2.0 *μ*M). This result was unexpected because S4877 was designed to be an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR and gefitinib was designed to be a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR.^[@bib1]^ Thus, the fact that S4877 inhibited cell proliferation in gefitinib-resistant cell lines was unexpected and suggested that S4877 might have

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4878 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4878 is not known, but it appears to be similar to that of the most commonly used non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), nevirapine. S4878 inhibits reverse transcriptase (RT) by blocking the enzyme at a site which is distal from the enzyme's active site. S4878 inhibits wild-type HIV-1 and a mutant of HIV-1, called L90M, which is resistant to nevirapine. S4878 also inhibits HIV-2, and it appears to be less susceptible to NNRTI-resistance mutations in HIV-2 than in HIV-1.

S4878 is metabolized in humans to an inactive compound, the sulfate metabolite, which is formed by the enzyme, sulfotransferase. Sulfation of S4878 results in a reduction of the antiviral activity. This metabolite is not incorporated into viral DNA

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4883 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4883 is unknown, but is not mediated by inhibition of DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV as shown in Table 1. It is possible that S4883 interferes with the formation of a functional ternary complex between gyrase, ATP and DNA. S4883 is a well tolerated compound with excellent drug-like properties, and it has a significant antibacterial activity against strains with high levels of quinolone resistance (MIC90 0.06 µg/ml).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4885 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4885 is still not clear. S4885 may inhibit the expression of fibrogenic cytokines and enzymes in fibroblasts. As a result, the production of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and fibronectin, decreases. The reduction of fibrosis by S4885 might be related to the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways.

TGF-β1 is an important cytokine in the development of liver fibrosis. It induces the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins in fibroblasts, leading to the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix production is regulated by Smad and non-Smad pathways.[@b26-gnl-08-471] In the Smad pathway, Smad2 and Smad3 bind to the TGF-β1 receptor complex, and the complex forms

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4886 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4886 is unique. S4886 blocks P2Y~12~ receptors in platelets. P2Y~12~ receptors are activated by ADP released from platelets in the blood, leading to aggregation of platelets and the activation of coagulation factors. P2Y~12~ receptor antagonists such as ticagrelor and cangrelor prevent the platelet aggregation and coagulation cascade, resulting in reduced thrombus formation in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4887 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4887 is unknown. It is a protein-synthesis inhibitor. S4887 is an orally administered small molecule that binds to a region of the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA for the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), thereby inhibiting the translation of the CXCR4 protein. This protein is important for T-cell homing and survival, as it is required for the adhesion of T-cells to the bone marrow microenvironment. S4887 is a highly selective inhibitor of CXCR4 translation, and inhibits CXCR4-mediated cell migration.

Chemistry
S4887 was discovered by screening for compounds that would inhibit CXCR4-mediated cell migration.

However, it has a high affinity for the human 5-HT~2B~ receptor, with a Ki value of 0.28 nM and a pKi value of 8.02, indicating that S4931 is \~10-fold more potent at the 5-HT~2B~ receptor than at the 5-HT~2C~ receptor.^[@bib16]^ At the 5-HT~2B~ receptor, S4931 acts as an antagonist at the orthosteric binding site. In addition, S4931 interacts with the 5-HT~2B~ receptor at a site distinct from the orthosteric binding site.^[@bib16]^ In the present study, we demonstrate that the S4931-induced activation

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4932 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4932 is mediated by inhibition of protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of the eIF2α subunit. S4932 was developed for use in patients with HIV infection and a CD4 count of \<350 cells/mm^3^ and in patients with a history of prior failure with at least one PI-containing regimen.

S4932 was studied in three phase III trials, each of which was randomized and double-blinded, and included a treatment-naive subgroup. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA \<50 copies/mL at week 48. A post hoc analysis of pooled data from the three trials showed a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA \<50 copies/mL at week 48 with S4932-containing regimens (48%) than with control regimens (28%) (*P*\<0.0001).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4933 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4933 is based on its ability to block the enzymatic activity of FASN and decrease the level of FASN protein. However, the use of S4933 is complicated by its dual inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and FASN. This was seen in a study in which S4933 decreased LDL-C by \~40% in a clinical trial, but when a combination of statin and S4933 was used, the LDL-C was lowered by \~50% \[[@B29-ijms-18-01991]\]. Thus, there are potential negative side effects associated with S4933. However, S4933 may still have clinical utility. As the next-generation FASN inhibitor, A-922500, was more potent than S4933, the side effects of A-922500 were examined. A-922500 did not affect the levels of HMG

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4939 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4939 is the binding of a compound to the growth factor receptors of the erbB family and to the tyrosine kinase domains of these receptors.
S4939 was identified as a specific inhibitor of the erbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and the erbB-2-mediated signal transduction pathway (see copending and commonly owned PCT International Publication No. WO 99/59934). S4939 is a selective inhibitor of the erbB-2 tyrosine kinase (erbB-2-TK) and is a potent inhibitor of the growth of human tumor cells that express erbB-2.
S4939 has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cells that overexpress erbB-2, including breast cancer cells that overexpress erbB-2. The inhibition of erbB-2 by S4939 is effective in reducing tumor

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4940 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4940 is to block the interaction between VEGF and its receptors. This action inhibits angiogenesis and thus decreases the amount of oxygen required to sustain tumor growth. S4940 is being developed as an oral treatment for the treatment of solid tumors and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase I trials of S4940 were completed in the summer of 2002. A Phase II trial in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently underway.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4949 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4949 is not fully understood. A large number of studies have shown that, in addition to the stimulation of Na+ channels, S4949 may also activate other types of ion channels, such as the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, L-type Ca2+ channels, and NMDA receptors.

Adverse effects
S4949 has been found to have a dose-dependent effect on the QT interval, but not on the PR or QRS intervals. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering this drug to patients with long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, or hypothyroidism.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4952 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4952 is unknown, but its dose-dependent effect on neutrophil survival, adhesion, and degranulation, and its ability to reduce circulating NETs, suggest a direct effect on NETs. Future studies will explore this hypothesis and investigate the ability of S4952 to directly affect NETs in vivo.

Although S4952 reduced NETosis in vivo, the exact mechanism of action of this compound remains to be elucidated. NETosis is dependent on a number of signaling pathways, including calcium, reactive oxygen species, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Akt, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase [@bib15]. S4952 has been shown to activate phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase [@bib16] and to inhibit calcium-dependent kinase II [@bib17], both of which are potential signaling pathways involved in NETosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4957 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4957 is poorly understood. The compound has been reported to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity in vitro at the level of NADPH formation and in vivo in the rat at concentrations that are close to those needed for efficacy in the mouse and dog (Lange et al. Antiviral Research 37, 73-81 (1996)). S4957 also inhibits the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in vivo (Veeck et al. Biochemical Pharmacology, 56, 819-828 (1999)). The potential role of S4957 in lipid metabolism is suggested by the ability of the compound to increase the concentration of carnitine in the plasma (Nishikawa et al.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4958 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4958 is related to the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells \[[@CR15]\]. The activity of S4958 is selective for cancer cells, because it does not affect the viability of normal cells. Several studies have demonstrated that S4958 induces apoptosis in cancer cells, such as melanoma, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, colon, gastric, breast, lung, renal, bladder, head and neck, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells \[[@CR15], [@CR17]--[@CR22]\]. The mechanism of apoptosis induced by S4958 is closely related to the induction of caspase-3, -8, -9, and -10, and Bax, Fas, and Bcl-2 protein expression.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4971 is not well understood. The compound may inhibit the proton pump, and thereby decrease the rate of hydrogen production in the mitochondria, which could result in reduced energy production. In addition, S4971 inhibits the proton pump and decreases the production of lactic acid. The compound may also inhibit the oxidative phosphorylation system by affecting mitochondrial membrane potential. S4971 also inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, which is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of toxic aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal. Inhibition of ALDH activity may lead to accumulation of toxic aldehydes in the cell.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4975 is unclear. This agent acts through the P2Y~1~ receptor. In preclinical models, S4975 reduced infarct size in a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat hearts. S4975 also increased the ejection fraction in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and a model of ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat hearts.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4976 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4976 is similar to that of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), which are produced by reduction of nitric oxide (NO) with thiols in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). SNOs are relatively stable and may be considered to be nitrosyl analogues of glutathione. S-nitrosylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including stroke, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases.
The direct measurement of SNO levels in biological samples is a powerful tool for elucidating the biological function of this important class of protein post-translational modifications. Such measurements may be used to elucidate the role of SNO in a variety of diseases and disorders including, but not limited to, cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4977 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4977 is related to its effects on the S-phase checkpoint. DNA replication in the absence of S-phase checkpoints leads to genome instability and, eventually, to the development of cancer. Thus, S-phase checkpoint defects are a common feature of human cancer cells. The presence of an S-phase checkpoint ensures that the DNA replication process is terminated when DNA damage is detected. This DNA damage can be either spontaneous or induced by a variety of environmental factors. The S-phase checkpoint has two distinct arms: a replication-coupled response, which is induced by agents that block DNA replication and an independent response, which is induced by agents that damage DNA directly. The ATR kinase is a major regulator of the S-phase checkpoint and plays a central role in the replication-coupled response. The ATR kinase responds to DNA damage by phosphorylating and activating the checkpoint kinase Chk1, which, in turn, phosphory

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4978 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4978 is not well understood. The primary effect is a reduction in the activity of PDE4 and this is accompanied by a reduction in the level of cAMP. However, the IC50 for the PDE4 inhibitory activity of S4978 is 100 nM, which is considerably higher than the Kd for cAMP binding to the receptor. This suggests that S4978 is a weak inverse agonist.
The effects of S4978 are not limited to immunosuppression. S4978 has been shown to be active in the following disease models:
1) TNFα-induced release of IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-1ra from human peripheral blood leukocytes (Sudhof T C, et al., Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Jun. 3; 54(5):859-69).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4980 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4980 is not well understood. It is possible that the chemical modification of the non-toxic antibiotic ciprofloxacin by the addition of the quaternary ammonium salt S4980 is a result of the binding of the antibiotic to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, causing disruption of the membrane structure and permeability. This would result in the uptake of the ciprofloxacin by the bacteria and an increased susceptibility to the antibiotic. Alternatively, it is possible that the activity of S4980 is the result of its direct interaction with the ribosome of Gram-positive bacteria, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and ultimately leading to cell death.

Further work will be required to identify the exact mechanism of action of S4980, but this quaternary ammonium salt is a promising candidate for the development of a novel anti-infective agent.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4983 is still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify a molecular target of S4983. To identify the target, we carried out a cDNA microarray analysis of genes induced by S4983. In the S4983-induced cells, 462 genes were upregulated and 616 genes were downregulated. One of the downregulated genes was a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p27Kip1. This is the first report that p27Kip1 is downregulated by an anti-cancer agent.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4986 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4986 is to enhance apoptosis of CLL cells and/or inhibit proliferation of CLL cells. The mechanism of action of S4986 is not known, but it is hypothesized that S4986 may cause apoptosis of CLL cells by altering mitochondrial function. The clinical efficacy of S4986 was tested in a phase I/II trial in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. The results showed that treatment with S4986 was safe and well tolerated and that some patients had significant reductions in their CLL cells and in their serum levels of markers of disease activity. However, the results of this trial have not yet been published. The pharmacokinetics of S4986 were studied in a phase I clinical trial in which patients received intravenous infusion of S4986 at doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/kg/day for 5 days.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4988 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4988 is related to its effect on the production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. LTB4 is produced by the action of 5-lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid and its release is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) (Leung et al., Biochem. J. 243:659-666, 1987). S4988 inhibits the production of LTB4 by blocking the action of PKC. S4988 is also effective in inhibiting the production of other eicosanoids, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2).
Because of the foregoing activity, S4988 is useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and inflammation of the respiratory tract. It also has activity in the treatment of allergic disorders, including asthma, and for the treatment

Thus, S4991 acts on the inducible form of NOS by binding to the [Fe4S4] cluster and blocking the reductase activity of NOS, preventing the generation of the reactive oxidant species. The antioxidant properties of S4991 may be responsible for the beneficial effects of S4991 in cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

Response: The mechanism of action of S4994 is still unclear. It could be either direct or indirect. On one hand, it could be an enhancer of the activity of TNF-α, thus the direct action of the drug is the most likely mechanism. On the other hand, it could enhance the activity of IFN-γ, thus the indirect mechanism could be the most likely.

Although S4994 is a promising agent, the future of this drug is still under investigation. In order to clarify the mechanism of action of S4994, its effect on the release of cytokines by human PBMCs will be investigated in the future. The detailed mechanism of action of S4994 in the treatment of RA will be investigated in the future.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S4996 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S4996 is based on the fact that p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that acts in concert with other transcription factors, such as NF-kB, to regulate gene expression. S4996 specifically inhibits the function of p53 by binding to the p53-transactivation domain and blocking its ability to activate the transcription of target genes. In this way, S4996 induces apoptosis in cancer cells by down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. In addition, S4996 also inhibits the growth of tumors by blocking cell cycle progression and inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest.

Clinical trial results

Response: The mechanism of action of S5010 is a mixture of both effects. On one hand, S5010 inhibits the DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates (PARP1, p53, etc.), which leads to apoptosis. On the other hand, S5010 inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

In summary, our study reveals that S5010 is a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of DNA-PKcs. S5010 may be a useful compound for the treatment of DNA-PK-associated diseases.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5013 is not known but there are several possible explanations. The precise mechanism of action is unknown for many treatments and this may be true for S5013. It may also be true for other treatments that have similar mechanisms of action. These include treatments such as exemestane (Aromasin) which is also a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, bicalutamide (Casodex) which is a non-steroidal antiandrogen, and letrozole (Femara) which is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. The mechanism of action for all of these treatments is inhibition of androgen biosynthesis.

S5013 may act on androgen biosynthesis in a similar way to the other treatments listed above. However, the metabolism of S5013 may be different to these other treatments.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5015 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5015 is a modification of the existing mTOR inhibitors, in that S5015 has an improved pharmacokinetic profile with a greater systemic exposure and lower clearance compared to the current generation of mTOR inhibitors. It is anticipated that the improved exposure of S5015 will provide a more effective treatment option for patients with mTOR inhibitor-refractory solid tumors.

The safety and tolerability profile of S5015 was evaluated in a phase 1 study. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and recommended phase 2 dose in combination with erlotinib. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of S5015 and determination of the pharmacodynamic effects of S5015 in patients with solid tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5016 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5016 is not yet known. S5016 is a hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor. MMPs are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is essential for cell growth and migration, and the inhibition of MMPs may result in tumor growth inhibition and cell death. In addition, MMPs are also involved in angiogenesis and the invasion of cancer cells. It is also possible that the inhibition of MMPs will reduce angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion and therefore may lead to the inhibition of tumor growth. However, there are many other MMPs that have been identified, and therefore, there is potential for off-target activity of S5016.

A large number of proteases have been identified in cancer cells and cancer tissues. Proteases are also known to play a role in the metastasis of cancer cells. MMPs, a subgroup of the protease family

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5018 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5018 is still unknown. Although the results of this study have some limitations, this is the first study that evaluated the effect of the bioactive compound S5018 on the suppression of SSc-associated fibroblast activation and migration in a culture model.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of S5018 on SSc-associated fibroblast activation. This compound has been reported to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in an in vitro osteoclastogenesis model \[[@CR14]\]. S5018 may have a novel role in the suppression of SSc-associated fibroblast activation.

S5018 has a molecular weight of 927.3 Da, a log P of 2.01, and an octanol/water partition coefficient of 3.6. S5018 is a hydrophobic compound and has low solubility in water (0.015 mg/mL).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5019 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5019 is believed to be mediated by the inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Fibroblasts are a critical component of the wound healing process and play a major role in the deposition of collagen in the wound. This, in turn, is critical to the subsequent development of a mature scar. Accordingly, the inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis by S5019 is believed to be a major contributor to the efficacy of S5019 in the treatment of cutaneous wounds. The effects of S5019 on the proliferation and collagen synthesis of human dermal fibroblasts were studied in vitro. The results indicated that S5019 inhibits the proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts in a dose dependent manner and reduces the production of type I collagen. S5019 was effective in inhibiting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts at a concentration as low as 0.1 μM. The anti-proliferative effect

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5020 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5020 is a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and/or an increase in myocardial oxygen extraction, resulting in a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. The first two hours after administration of S5020 are critical for survival in the clinical setting, and thus, its safety and efficacy are best evaluated in the early post-resuscitation period. However, because the duration of efficacy of S5020 is unknown, long-term effects should be considered when using this drug.

Our findings are consistent with the results of the first clinical study, in which significant increases in blood pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and oxygen delivery were observed after administration of S5020. In the subsequent phase II study, the survival rate of patients treated with S5020 was higher than that of patients treated with placebo, even though the rate of post-resuscitation shock was higher in the S5020 group than in the placebo group.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5023 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5023 is to inhibit the *N*-acetylation of NAs that are incorporated into DNA and RNA. The *N*-acetylation of NAs is catalysed by the enzyme NAT, which transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the free amine of NAs. S5023 inhibits the enzyme NAT and thus reduces the level of acetylated NAs. In the absence of NAT, there is an accumulation of acetylated NAs, which leads to an imbalance of nucleoside triphosphate pools. This results in increased phosphorylation of the NAs, and subsequent misincorporation of the NAs into DNA and RNA. The accumulation of acetylated NAs and the imbalance of nucleoside triphosphate pools lead to reduced growth and cell death.

The ability of S5023 to inhibit NAT was demonstrated in *E. coli* cells, which contain an

Chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents for advanced breast cancer
=======================================================================

Chemotherapy
------------

The major systemic therapies for metastatic breast cancer include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and biological therapy. For the past decade, the standard treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer has been combination chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is used in patients with rapidly progressing, heavily pretreated disease and those with visceral metastases and a poor performance status. In addition, combination chemotherapy is often used as neoadjuvant treatment for operable disease, as adjuvant treatment for early-stage disease, and for palliative treatment of metastatic disease. The regimens most commonly used in the United States are based on anthracycl

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5028 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5028 is through direct inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and thus reduces signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). S5028 has also been shown to reduce phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in cancer cells and is being developed for the treatment of various cancer types.

S5028 is under clinical development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced solid tumors. It has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of NSCLC by the FDA and the EMA.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5030 is unclear. However, a recent report suggests that in addition to targeting the active site of HIV-1 integrase, S5030 also interacts with the allosteric pocket of the enzyme ([@B40]).

The inhibitory activity of S5030 has been reported to be active against different HIV-1 strains including CRF01_AE, subtype B, CRF01_AE and subtype B/C recombinants ([@B41]--[@B44]).

The results of this study showed that S5030 has activity against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. The EC~50~ values of S5030 against WT HIV-1 subtype B strain (HXB2) and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains were all lower than the EC~50~ value against HIV-1 strain NL4-3, and all EC~50~ values were in the range of 5--7

Response: The mechanism of action of S5031 is unknown. However, it is assumed that S5031 binds to a site on a cytosolic protein to prevent protein phosphorylation and in turn inhibits the transcription of genes required for cell proliferation.

Clinical trials

Phase I
A Phase I trial was conducted in normal volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single ascending oral doses of S5031. S5031 was administered orally at single doses of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg. Doses of 40 and 160 mg were well tolerated and did not cause any clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. The plasma concentrations of S5031 increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 5–160 mg. S5031 was absorbed rapidly after oral administration. The plasma half-life of S5031 was between 2 and 5 h, and the mean systemic clearance of S5031

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5032 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5032 is not known. It has been suggested that S5032 acts by inhibiting the influx of extracellular Ca^2+^ and the release of intracellular Ca^2+^ stores into the cytosol \[[@B33]\]. However, the relative contributions of the intracellular Ca^2+^ stores to the cytosolic Ca^2+^ increase following the activation of muscarinic receptors have not been determined. The possibility that S5032 acts by inhibiting voltage-dependent Ca^2+^ channels has not been ruled out.

Conclusion
==========

The results of this study suggest that S5032 is a potent antagonist of muscarinic receptors that inhibit phospholipase C in both smooth muscle and endothelial cells. These effects may contribute to the antinociceptive effects of S5032 observed in models of acute pain in the rat.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5036 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5036 is related to the increased permeability of the plasma membrane of cancer cells through induction of Bax-mediated apoptosis. Bax is a proapoptotic protein that plays a key role in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In this study, we observed the induction of Bax expression in S5036-treated cells. Bax expression was also observed in S5036-treated mice. The expression of Bax in the S5036-treated mice was induced in the spleen and thymus, but not in the lung, heart, liver, and kidney. These results suggested that S5036 induces apoptosis in cancer cells by inducing the expression of Bax in cancer cells and by translocating Bax from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial membrane.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5039 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5039 is related to its ability to modulate the inositol lipid cycle. It has been demonstrated that inositol phosphate levels in cultured rat astrocytes increase in response to treatment with S5039. This is followed by an increase in [3H]inositol labeling of the lipid moiety of the inositol phosphate second messenger pathway, suggesting that the mechanism of action of S5039 is at the level of the phosphatidylinositol cycle. In contrast, in vivo administration of S5039 to rats did not affect [3H]inositol labeling of inositol phospholipids. This discrepancy is not due to a direct effect of S5039 on phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis since incubation of rat brain homogenates with S5039 does not increase [3H]inositol labeling of phosphatidylinositol. In vitro experiments showed that S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5040 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5040 is similar to that of other thienamycin antibiotics. They inhibit the protein synthesis by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosome and preventing peptide bond formation. The high potency and broad spectrum of action of S5040 make it a potentially useful antibiotic for the treatment of serious bacterial infections.

Synthesis

S5040 was synthesized in three steps starting from 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (Scheme 1).

In the first step, methyl esterification of the alcohol is performed in the presence of NaH and catalytic amount of DMAP to give the corresponding acid (1).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5043 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5043 is likely to be complex. Recent studies have indicated that S5043 induces cell death by a process of apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cell lines, including gastric, breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer cells \[[@B22],[@B23]\]. However, the precise mechanism of S5043-induced apoptosis is still unknown. We observed that S5043 induced activation of caspase-3, a downstream executioner caspase in the caspase cascade. However, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, which regulate mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, did not change in S5043-treated cells. Thus, we suggest that S5043-induced apoptosis occurs by a caspase-dependent mechanism. We also observed that S5043 increased the expression of p53, an important regulator of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We previously showed that S5043 inhibited cell

It has been shown that, at high concentrations, S5051 inhibits H+-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for acidification of the endosomes and lysosomes. However, it is not known whether S5051 is internalized by the cells. Moreover, it has been shown that S5051 causes rapid, massive degradation of the endosomal and lysosomal membranes. The precise mechanism of action of S5051 in the treatment of malaria has yet to be established.

However, their mechanism of action is not fully understood, and they may also have other, as yet undetermined, actions. Cyclosporin A is an immunosuppressive agent that binds to cyclophilin and inhibits T-cell activation. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of SLE, but is associated with side effects.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5056 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5056 is thought to involve a prolonged reduction in the intracellular levels of ATP, leading to a reduction in the concentration of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, followed by a more prolonged inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump, leading to an increased concentration of intracellular sodium and an increase in intracellular calcium concentration.  S5056 is a non-competitive antagonist of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel.  This means that it does not block the potassium channel itself, but it blocks the binding of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel to its ligand.  The potassium channel is thought to be a target for S5056.

This action of S5059 is similar to that of a specific inhibitor of farnesylation, farnesyl protein transferase (FTase) \[[@CR11]\]. S5059 also inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells \[[@CR12]\]. However, this agent was not effective in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease \[[@CR18]\

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5060 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5060 is based on the induction of ROS generation by a single dose of the compound. S5060 induced ROS production in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was prevented by NAC (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}). However, S5060 did not significantly alter the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) or induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}). In addition, S5060 did not significantly alter the levels of ROS in the MCF-7 cells, and this is in agreement with our previous results \[[@CR14]\]. The inhibition of ROS production by NAC was confirmed in the present study (Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}). Furthermore, S5060 significantly reduced the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5062 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5062 is still unknown, however, it is possible that the inhibition of S100A4 affects the adhesion, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. In addition, the expression of S100A4 in melanoma cells may be correlated with the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells, which may affect the sensitivity of melanoma cells to S5062. Therefore, S5062 could be a promising drug for the treatment of melanoma.

Conclusion {#Sec18}
==========

In conclusion, our results indicated that S5062 is a potential candidate for the treatment of melanoma. However, the detailed mechanism of action of S5062 in the inhibition of melanoma invasion and metastasis needs further research.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5063 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5063 is not fully understood. As S5063 is a combination of chlorpromazine and dantrolene, the mechanism of action is likely to be related to the mechanism of action of chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine antipsychotic and acts as a blocker of dopamine receptors. Dantrolene is a drug used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, with its mechanism of action thought to be inhibition of skeletal muscle calcium uptake.

In phase I studies, S5063 was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, dizziness, somnolence, nausea and abdominal pain. Adverse events occurred in over 30% of patients, and the severity of adverse events was mild or moderate.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5065 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5065 is complex. The drug inhibits the catalytic activity of telomerase, which is associated with a reduction in telomerase activity and cell proliferation, leading to telomere shortening. However, this drug also inhibits topoisomerase II, and the topoisomerase II inhibition may be responsible for the induction of apoptosis \[[@B37]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5066 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5066 is different from that of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The latter block the estrogen receptor (ER) by binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and preventing the receptor from interacting with the coactivators. However, S5066, by binding to the N-terminal AF-2 domain, prevents coactivators from interacting with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the ER and transcription of estrogen-responsive genes. S5066 and its analogs have shown efficacy in animal models of estrogen-dependent cancers such as endometrial and breast cancer.

S5066 and its analogs have also been shown to be effective in treating the hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause.

Side effects
The main side effects associated with S5066 are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and bone marrow suppression. The compounds are generally well tolerated. However, in some cases,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5067 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5067 is currently under investigation, and it is known to inhibit the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes and therefore of inflammation.
The compound S5067 is a prodrug, which is metabolized in the body to the active compound. The prodrug can be prepared by derivatizing the amino group of the prodrug to a reactive ester or amide group, such as the t-butyl ester or the t-butyl amide. The prodrug is rapidly hydrolyzed by enzymes, such as esterases, to the active compound. The t-butyl ester is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active compound, whereas the t-butyl amide is more stable. The compound S5067 has been prepared as a t-butyl ester and as a t-butyl amide.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5069 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5069 is not fully understood. A postulated mode of action is that S5069 increases the uptake of trivalent cations, especially aluminium, by macrophages.

Clinical studies

The effects of S5069 were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 36 healthy volunteers with aluminium (AI) exposure (as measured by the serum aluminium-binding capacity). After a 10-day oral treatment with either S5069 (20 mg/day) or placebo, the serum aluminium-binding capacity increased by 39.8% in the placebo group and by 59.5% in the S5069 group (p=0.02).

A second clinical study investigated the effects of S5069 in subjects with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a mild to moderate renal impairment (RI). In this study, 44 patients were randomly assigned to

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5070 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5070 is poorly understood, but it is speculated that it may be an agonist of TRPV1. A comparison of the pharmacological profile of S5070 with other TRPV1 agonists showed that S5070 has the highest efficacy at the human TRPV1 receptor (EC50 = 9 nM) and the lowest efficacy at the rat TRPV1 receptor (EC50 = 270 nM). In addition, S5070 has no activity at TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, and TRPM8 receptors.

S5070 is a potent and selective TRPV1 agonist with no activity at other TRP channels, including TRPV1 itself. The high efficacy of S5070 at human TRPV1 and its lack of activity at rat TRPV1 suggests that S5070 may be a human-specific TRPV1 agonist.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5072 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5072 is currently under investigation. A phase I study of S5072 in patients with advanced solid tumors was completed. Patients received single agent S5072 at doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/m(2) by 24-hour infusion. The recommended phase II dose was 1.0 mg/m(2). Commonly observed adverse events included neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 diarrhea, grade 4 neutropenia, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia. The recommended phase II dose was 1.0 mg/m(2). S5072 has a manageable safety profile and is a promising new agent for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5073 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5073 is believed to be related to the inhibition of the cell cycle by S5073 and the resulting arrest of the cells in G2/M phase.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5076 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5076 is as follows: the drugs are converted to their metabolites, S5077 and S5078, which are the active components, by a P450 (CYP3A4) in the liver. These metabolites then bind to the nuclear receptor CAR and activate the transcription of CYP3A4 genes. Thus, S5076 activates CYP3A4 genes and the conversion of drugs by CYP3A4 is increased, thereby enhancing the effect of the drug.[@b2-dddt-10-2211]

The safety of S5076 was examined in rats. At the oral dose of 10 mg/kg, no death or abnormalities in body weight, food intake, hematology, blood chemistry, or histopathology were observed in rats. In addition, there were no abnormal changes in the hematology and blood chemistry parameters, organ weights, or histopathology in the vital organs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5079 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5079 is believed to be due to its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the activated state, which in turn causes dephosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of PI3K, and subsequently, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and activation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5082VitaminK2 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5082VitaminK2 is as follows: The protein produced by the gene encodes a vitamin K2 binding protein. The vitamin K2 binding protein binds vitamin K2 to the enzyme protein, thereby inhibiting the enzyme from being activated. When vitamin K2 is bound to the vitamin K2 binding protein, it is no longer able to be converted to a coenzyme by the enzyme. The vitamin K2 is therefore not able to activate the enzyme. When the enzyme is inhibited, it is unable to catalyze the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, resulting in a decreased level of thrombin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5091 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5091 is not known, however, several possibilities exist: (1) S5091 could act as a binder to block the receptor binding site on NMDARs, and therefore preventing glutamate from binding to the receptor, or (2) S5091 could act as a positive allosteric modulator by binding to the glutamate binding site of NMDARs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5096 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5096 is unknown.

S5096 is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors. It has high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor and a very high affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor.

History

S5096 was first reported in 2001 and was identified as a novel and selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. In vitro assays confirmed the selectivity of S5096 for the 5-HT1A receptor over the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT7, α1, α2, and D2 receptors.

S5096 was first investigated in animal models of anxiety and depression. It was found to be an anxiolytic in animal models of anxiety, such as the elevated plus maze, and the Vogel conflict test.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5097 is similar to that of rifampin. However, the mechanism of action of S5097 is more rapid than that of rifampin, resulting in more rapid and complete bacterial killing. The drug exhibits in-vitro activity against both rifampin-susceptible and rifampin-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, and in-vivo activity against the bacilli in murine models of tuberculosis.

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study in patients with smear-positive, drug-susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis, S5097 was well tolerated, and showed promising efficacy and bacteriologic activity, including in patients with prior treatment failure or resistance to rifampin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5100 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5100 is believed to be as follows. (1) S5100 binds to and blocks the binding of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), to the surface of the vascular smooth muscle cell. (2) The binding of growth factors to the surface of the vascular smooth muscle cell is known to activate the cell and to induce mitogenesis, which leads to the formation of new blood vessels. (3) S5100 is believed to prevent the activation of the cell, thereby preventing the formation of new blood vessels.
It is believed that, in normal tissue, S5100 inhibits the formation of new blood vessels, and thus inhibits the growth of tumor tissue. However, in tumors, S5100 is internalized by the vascular smooth muscle cells in the tumor. The internalized S5100 is then released from the tumor cells and binds to the surface of the vascular smooth muscle cells. This binding is believed to block the binding

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5102 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5102 is unclear, but it appears to be specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is most likely to act by binding to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is likely to be similar to that of SARS-CoV. This is supported by the S5102 IC~50~ value of 5 μM for SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to that of the SARS-CoV IC~50~ value of 10 μM (Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}). S5102 was tested in Vero E6 cells at a concentration of 10 μM, and the results showed no toxicity. This is in contrast to the in vitro cytotoxicity profile of a similar compound, the humanized monoclonal antibody against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which showed a similar

Response: The mechanism of action of S5108 is currently under investigation.

Phase II/III trials {#sec2-5}
-------------------

A total of 72 patients with advanced cancer have been enrolled in phase II/III trials of S5108. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 600 mg/m^2^. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in patients at the 600 mg/m^2^ dose level. The MTD of S5108 was determined to be 300 mg/m^2^.

The phase II study of S5108 was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study.\[[@ref21]\] It evaluated the efficacy and safety of S5108 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 20 patients with solid tumors refractory to standard therapies were enrolled. The primary endpoint of the study was the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5109 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5109 is through the activation of multiple cell-signaling pathways. A study by Lee et al. reported that S5109 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, induced apoptosis, and activated p38 MAPK in human renal cancer cells \[[@B31-ijms-21-01798]\]. S5109 induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, which was mediated by the mitochondria-dependent pathway \[[@B31-ijms-21-01798]\]. Another study by Wohn et al. reported that S5109 induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as the mitochondrial pathway, which was mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway \[[@B32-ijms-21-01798]\]. These findings were consistent with our data.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5112 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5112 is based on a combined effect of the inhibition of the intracellular and extracellular conversion of the vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), to the hormonally active form, 1,25D3, and on the induction of apoptosis. In this study, the inhibitory effect of S5112 on the intracellular formation of 1,25D3 was studied in different human cancer cell lines, which are known to be 1,25D3-sensitive or insensitive. The activity of the vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), was also determined.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5113 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5113 is based on the restoration of nuclear GHRH receptor expression in pituitary tumor cells, thereby leading to down-regulation of GHRH signaling and a decrease in GH secretion. The drug is a non-peptidyl GHRH analog. S5113 has a high binding affinity for the GHRH receptor and is selective for the GHRH receptor compared to the somatostatin receptor subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 5. S5113 is also an antagonist of the somatostatin receptor.

History
S5113 was developed by Sandoz and was first evaluated in a Phase I study in patients with advanced hormone-secreting pituitary tumors (Kumar et al. 1998). In the study, a single-dose of S5113 was administered as an intravenous infusion to 18 patients. The patients had been previously treated with bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5114 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5114 is different from that of erlotinib, as it inhibits not only the activity of the EGFR but also the activity of the MET tyrosine kinase, which is another receptor for HGF. S5114 shows synergistic effects with gefitinib and cetuximab, and has been found to inhibit the growth of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells.

As a new type of oral TKI, S5114 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, by inhibiting the activity of both the EGFR and MET. In addition, S5114 has the advantage of inhibiting the activity of EGFR in the nucleus.

S5114 was well tolerated in a Phase I dose-escalation study in Japanese patients with solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined, but

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5117 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5117 is different from that of traditional chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel. Paclitaxel inhibits the cell cycle and causes the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. However, S5117 causes the accumulation of cells in the G1/S phase. In contrast, paclitaxel causes the activation of phosphorylated p53 and increases the expression of p21, leading to cell cycle arrest. However, S5117 does not cause the activation of p53 and p21, and instead, it inhibits the expression of cyclin D1 and increases the expression of p27, which leads to cell cycle arrest. In addition, paclitaxel causes apoptosis, but S5117 causes cell cycle arrest without inducing apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5121 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5121 is still unknown. However, it is assumed that S5121 acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus. The key point of S5121 as a transcription factor is that it regulates the expression of *VEGF* and *BMP4*, which are important for promoting EMT and invasion, by directly binding to the promoter of *VEGF* and *BMP4*.

Aberrant expression of *VEGF* and *BMP4* is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. The effect of VEGF on tumor progression has been well established. The activation of VEGF by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is known to be important for cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The binding of VEGF to its receptors activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which stimulates the nuclear translocation of transcription

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5134 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5134 is a unique fusion of 2 compounds:

1.  **5-fluorouracil (5-FU)**: a pyrimidine analog, 5-FU is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents. It is active against a broad spectrum of solid tumors and leukemia. 5-FU can be converted into the 5-FU metabolite **S5133**, which is an antimetabolite. S5133 is an inhibitor of the thymidylate synthase enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine.

2.  **CDP-ethanolamine**: a lipid compound. CDP-ethanolamine is a lipid metabolite that is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Inhibition of CDP-ethanolamine synthesis can cause an accumulation of choline, which may be toxic to tumor cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5136 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5136 is still under investigation. The observation that S5136 increases nuclear S-phase cells in the presence of DSB-inducing agents is consistent with S5136's activity as a topoisomerase II inhibitor and is not inconsistent with the observed effect of S5136 on ATM. It is also possible that S5136 may inhibit other enzymes, such as topoisomerase I or DNA polymerase δ.

S5136 was shown to be effective against a broad spectrum of tumor types including lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, glioma, and ovarian cancer. Its clinical activity was assessed in a phase II trial in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (Cancer and Leukemia Group B Protocol 9511).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5138 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5138 is believed to be through the inhibition of protein kinase C.

Development
S5138 was discovered as a selective, non-toxic, orally bioavailable and potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) in a high throughput screening (HTS) of a chemical library by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL, USA).  This compound was originally discovered as a PKC inhibitor and has been extensively characterized as a PKC inhibitor.

Clinical trials
S5138 has been studied in several Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  These trials include a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study for Crohn's disease (Crohn's II) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study for ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients who have not responded to treatment with a 5-AS

The clinical development of S5143 was terminated by Novartis in 2016, with the development program focused on the potential of S5143 in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a phase 2b study, single doses of S5143 were administered to subjects with COPD. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, but the highest dose tested was determined to be the dose at which no dose‐limiting toxicities were observed. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar to placebo. However, dose‐dependent reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were observed, with a mean difference of 14.4 mL from placebo at the highest dose of S5143.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5163 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5163 is related to the formation of protein aggregates, but not to other modes of action. S5163 did not have a significant effect on the permeability of the BBB. S5163 was able to cross the BBB and inhibit the aggregation of PrP^Sc^ in the brain of RML-infected mice, as measured by PrP^Sc^ ELISA. The median inhibitory concentration (IC~50~) of S5163 was calculated to be 0.4 μM. S5163 was also effective in an intracerebral mouse scrapie model. However, S5163 did not significantly reduce the spongiform changes in the brains of the mice infected with RML or ME7. In addition, S5163 did not inhibit the propagation of prion infection in primary mouse neuronal cells. These results suggest that S5163 can be used as a candidate drug for the treatment of prion diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5206 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5206 is through blocking the BRCA2-A complex, leading to induction of DNA damage. This causes the BRCA2-A complex to become dysfunctional, resulting in the dissociation of RAD51 from BRCA2. In the absence of RAD51, the BRCA2-A complex is unable to activate the BRCA2-A-B complex, and therefore, cannot promote the homology search process. The lack of the BRCA2-A-B complex in the BRCA2-A complex would lead to the inhibition of HR. In the presence of S5206, the BRCA2-A complex is able to promote the BRCA2-A-B complex, which can repair DNA damage through HR.

To determine whether S5211 inhibits platelet aggregation in vivo, we evaluated its effect on the platelet aggregation induced by collagen in guinea pig platelets.

For this purpose, we used platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared from guinea pig blood as previously described \[[@B13]\]. The effect of S5211 on platelet aggregation was assessed in vitro. In these experiments, we used PRP (1 × 10^8^platelets/mL) and washed platelets (1 × 10^8^platelets/mL). S5211 (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µM) was added to PRP and platelet aggregation was induced by the addition of collagen (10 µg/mL). The results of these experiments are shown in [

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5213 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5213 is similar to that of the widely used antimalarial drug, atovaquone. It is believed that S5213 blocks the malaria parasite from the final stage of its life cycle by inhibiting the growth of asexual blood-stage parasites. It is also believed that S5213 exerts a synergistic effect with other antimalarial drugs. The drug was first disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 2003/076275.
S5213 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (1S,2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-N-{4-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-yl}benzamide and (1R,2S,4R)-4-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-2,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5217 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5217 is different from that of nifedipine, which is an L-type calcium channel blocker. S5217 inhibits both the entry of Ca^2+^ into the cell and the efflux of Ca^2+^ from the cell by inhibiting the activity of Na^+^/Ca^2+^-exchanger, without affecting the function of voltage-gated calcium channels. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of S5217 is higher than that of nifedipine. It has been reported that S5217 inhibits Ca^2+^ influx into vascular smooth muscle cells of the cerebral arteries in rats. However, it is not clear whether S5217 is effective in human subjects. Therefore, we performed a clinical trial of S5217 in patients with ischemic stroke.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5220 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5220 is likely to be through inhibition of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), as S5220 is a potent inhibitor of FGF-2 induced proliferation in human fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells \[[@B25-molecules-23-00458]\]. S5220 is a low molecular weight agent with a long half-life and good oral bioavailability in rats, mice and dogs \[[@B26-molecules-23-00458]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5223 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5223 is to bind to and inhibit P-gp (p-glycoprotein), which is a major contributor to the MDR (multidrug resistance) phenotype in human cancer cells. P-gp is a 170-180 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, which is encoded by the MDR1 gene and which is known to extrude a wide variety of structurally unrelated drugs, including vincristine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, topotecan, imatinib, and daunorubicin from the cell. When overexpressed, P-gp also reduces intracellular drug accumulation by reducing the amount of drug that can enter the cell. This is thought to be one of the mechanisms that is responsible for the MDR phenotype.
The MDR phenotype has been recognized as a major problem in cancer chemotherapy since the advent of cancer chemotherapy more than 50

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5224 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5224 is still unknown. S5224 may affect the pathophysiology of hypertension by affecting renin-angiotensin system, calcium channel, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, etc. ([@B1]). S5224 may be more effective than the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the treatment of hypertension and other diseases ([@B2]). However, ARBs or ACEIs have been demonstrated to have adverse reactions, such as dry cough, dizziness, headache, asthenia, edema, hypotension, etc. ([@B3]). Some of these adverse reactions are related to the dose of S5224.

The clinical data showed that the adverse reactions of S5224 were not as severe as those of other antihypertensive drugs. Some of the adverse reactions of S5224 are dose-dependent, but the dose-dependent

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5228 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5228 is similar to that of the S5226 series of compounds, but S5228 is a novel structural class of AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator that is not a partial agonist. In preclinical models of acute and chronic pain, S5228 has shown analgesic activity in both hot plate and tail-flick assays. In an LTP assay, S5228 enhanced synaptic strength, suggesting the potential for cognition enhancement. In an assay of the sedative/hypnotic properties of S5228, the compound demonstrated efficacy in this preclinical model. In addition, the results from an open-label, 12-week, phase 2 study of S5228 in subjects with fibromyalgia demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in pain, improvement in the sleep component of pain, and improvement in patient global impression of change, all without the use of opioid analgesics.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5229 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5229 is to bind to the S3 binding pocket of the kinase domain of Akt, causing inhibition of phosphorylation of the substrates of Akt, such as GSK-3β and FOXO1/3a, and ultimately inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, survival and migration \[[@R34], [@R35]\].

In this study, we showed that S5229 inhibits the growth of CRC cells by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Our data indicate that the anti-tumor activity of S5229 in CRC is mediated by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and S5229 was well tolerated in CRC cells and mice. S5229 significantly decreased the size of tumor xenografts and prolonged the survival of CRC tumor-bearing mice.

In conclusion, our study suggests that S5229 is a promising anti-cancer agent that may

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5232 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5232 is thought to involve inhibition of the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways and inhibition of the P53 pathway. S5232 inhibits both constitutive and ligand-induced signaling in the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. S5232 also inhibits ligand-induced signaling in the P53 pathway. S5232 is currently in phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic and advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

In vitro studies {#Sec11}

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5233 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5233 is not fully understood. It is assumed to be related to the stabilization of p53 and the subsequent induction of apoptosis in the cell. As p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis, the stabilized p53 is thought to trigger the activation of caspases and induce apoptosis. However, it has been reported that S5233 can induce cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase without activating p53 \[[@B40-molecules-22-00702]\]. In addition, the cytotoxicity of S5233 was not p53-dependent, as the cells expressing mutated p53 showed the same level of cell death as the cells expressing wild-type p53 \[[@B40-molecules-22-00702]\]. In addition, S5233 did not induce apoptosis in the cells that expressed p53 at the normal level. Therefore, S5233 may induce apoptosis in a

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5234 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5234 is still unknown.

There is no clear evidence that S5234 increases the serum levels of PTH. In our trial, the levels of PTH in the active treatment group were significantly higher than in the placebo group, but the differences were not significant when compared with baseline values. This may be due to the short period of time (24 h) during which PTH levels were assessed, which may not have been sufficient to detect any significant changes in PTH levels.

The trial was not powered to detect any changes in serum calcium levels. A significant decrease in serum calcium levels was observed in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group. This finding may be related to the fact that the drug is not absorbed in the intestine. As a result, S5234 may cause the intestine to absorb less calcium. The calcium levels were significantly lower than baseline values after treatment with the placebo, but the calcium levels were significantly higher than baseline values

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5238 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5238 is as follows. S5238 is designed to block the ATPase activity of the helicase domain of NS3/4A. In the replication complex, the NS3/4A helicase is a multi-subunit enzyme that unwinds the dsRNA genome and performs nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis and helicase activity. S5238 has a 2,4-dichlorobenzyl group that acts as a template for ATP hydrolysis. S5238 has a K~i~ value of 11.4 μM, a value similar to that of PPM0036, a compound that was identified in a high-throughput screen. S5238 was able to block the helicase activity of NS3/4A and showed good anti-HCV activity in a dose-dependent manner \[[@B65-viruses-10-00135]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S5239 is unknown, but S5239 has been shown to block the S1P-induced migration of Jurkat T cells and mouse T cells in vitro.^[@bib6]^ Furthermore, S5239 blocked the in vivo S1P-induced lymphopenia in mice, as shown by the increased number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of mice treated with S5239 (Figure [1c](#F1){ref-type="fig"}).

Although S5239 did not have significant effect on disease score, it blocked the lymphopenia caused by S1P.

S5240 induced down-regulation of cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6 and up-regulation of p21, p27 and p53. It also induced G1 phase arrest in G0/G1 phase by up-regulation of p16, p21 and p27. In addition, S5240 inhibited migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5242 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5242 is not fully understood, but S5242 is a specific inhibitor of AMPK that blocks phosphorylation of AMPK by the upstream kinase LKB1 \[[@B24]\]. The inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation is likely to be the key mechanism of action of S5242.

Our previous study showed that S5242 had little effect on AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 \[[@B24]\]. The present study showed that S5242 induced phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 in HCT116 and HEK293 cells ([Figure 1(b)](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). This is consistent with the observation that S5242 did not significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of AMPK in the previous study \[[@B24]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5245 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5245 is unknown. Although it does not have significant activity against most Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, the development of resistance to S5245 has not been observed in over 100 years of testing. It does not appear to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance-associated protein. S5245 does not inhibit topoisomerase IV. It does not inhibit mammalian protein synthesis.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absorption of S5245 is rapid and almost complete. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 2 hours. The peak plasma concentration is reached at 2 to 3 hours after the dose is administered. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 90%. S5245 is well absorbed following oral administration and does not require a food effect.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5246 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5246 is not known, but it is not the case that it binds to, and inhibits, the main ATP-binding site on the β-subunit.

It has been suggested that the mode of action of S5246 is the same as that of amiodarone, a drug which has been used for decades to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Amiodarone is a "benzofuranyl" drug which binds to a site on the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, at which it inhibits the ATP-dependent transport of Na+ ions across the membrane. This is important because the sodium pump is the main pathway for removal of excess Na+ ions from the cell, and this would result in increased intracellular Na+ concentration. This can cause cardiac arrest, so the Na,K-ATPase is an important target for pharmacological inhibition.

It has been suggested that S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5247 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5247 is not completely understood. In a phase II study of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, a dose of 80 mg/m2 given on days 1, 3, and 5 was not associated with an increase in the response rate, and in fact there was a decrease in the response rate when compared to historical controls [47]. This is consistent with preclinical studies showing that high dose cytarabine and 5-azacitidine produce synergistic anti-leukemia effects when combined with decitabine in mice [48].

The combination of decitabine and low dose cytarabine is also being studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In a phase II study of de novo AML, the combination of decitabine and low dose cytarabine produced a CR rate of 29% [49]. In a randomized phase II study of relapsed AML, the combination of decitab

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5248 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5248 is believed to be related to the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from damaged cells. S5248 is an inhibitor of the enzyme CD39, which is involved in the regulation of adenosine levels in the body. S5248 inhibits CD39 by blocking its active site. By blocking the active site of CD39, S5248 prevents the enzyme from cleaving ATP to form adenosine and ADP. Adenosine is a molecule that can relax smooth muscle in the gut and blood vessels, reduce inflammation, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. By blocking CD39, S5248 is believed to enhance the levels of adenosine in the body, and thereby reduce the inflammatory response and the symptoms associated with IBS.

Inhibition of the enzyme CD39 is a well-established mechanism for the treatment of asthma and atopic dermatitis, as the inhibition of this enzyme is believed to lead

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5250 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5250 is not fully understood, but it is believed that S5250 interferes with the P2X7 receptor, a nonselective cation channel. The P2X7 receptor is expressed in cells of the immune system, such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. S5250 is a novel, potent, and selective P2X7 receptor antagonist that is being developed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. S5250 is a thiazolopyridine derivative and is being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. S5250 has been shown to be effective in animal models of inflammation and joint destruction, including collagen-induced arthritis, Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis, and adjuvant arthritis. S5250 is also effective in an animal model of Crohn's disease.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5252 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5252 is believed to be a result of a decrease in Mcl-1 levels, an increase in the levels of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and a decrease in levels of Bcl-x~L~, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. However, further studies are required to confirm this.

In this study, we showed that S5252 was well tolerated and exhibited a significant antitumor activity in multiple xenograft models, including ovarian, breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Furthermore, in the clinically relevant xenograft model, we showed that S5252 has good tumor penetration and tumor accumulation. In addition, S5252 exhibited a potent activity against multiple tumor cell lines and showed a favorable PK profile. Therefore, S5252 could be an effective antitumor agent for multiple solid tumors.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5253 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5253 is still under investigation. However, we demonstrated that S5253 suppressed H3K27ac marks at the *BMP2* promoter and attenuated BMP2 expression in mMSCs. BMP2 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily, and is expressed by several cell types including MSCs. BMP2 promotes the formation of new bone and cartilage in the adult bone marrow \[[@CR21]\]. Therefore, BMP2 is considered as a promising therapeutic target for bone diseases. BMP2 binds to the BMP receptor (BMPR) and induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, which subsequently form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus. Smad1/5/8 then bind to BMP-response elements (BMPRE) in the promoter of BMP2 target genes. Smad1/5/8 and Sm

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5255 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5255 is currently unknown. However, there is a plausible link between inhibition of VEGF signalling and inhibition of tumour cell growth. Previous studies have shown that anti-angiogenic agents that target VEGF signalling can also inhibit tumour cell growth, for example, in the case of the anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin®), this is thought to be mediated by inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT and MAPK pathways \[[@B30]\]. Furthermore, the preclinical data for the antibody VEGF-trap (also known as rAAV2-anti-VEGF-A \[AAV2-VTC\]) suggests that it may also have activity in tumours where the target antigen is not VEGF-A but a related family member \[[@B31]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5256 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5256 is based on the inhibition of the kinase activity of the DNA damage response protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). It has been shown that ATM phosphorylates Ser5- and Ser15-linked ubiquitin chains to mark DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) for degradation by the proteasome. The kinase activity of ATM is activated by its phosphorylation on Ser1981 by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) at DSBs and it has been suggested that ATM and ATR may cooperate to detect and repair DSBs ([@bib9]). Although ATM has been identified as a central regulator of the DNA damage response, the signalling downstream of ATM is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ATM activation by S5256 is sufficient to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G~2~

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5257 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5257 is likely to be through induction of p53 mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, a number of studies have suggested that S5257 can also inhibit telomerase activity and/or telomere elongation \[[@R11], [@R14], [@R20]\]. As a consequence, we sought to determine whether telomerase inhibition was involved in S5257 mediated apoptosis. To do this, we first investigated whether the mechanism of S5257 mediated apoptosis was associated with changes in telomerase activity and telomere length. We have previously shown that exposure of HL60 cells to S5257 results in an increase in telomerase activity and telomere elongation \[[@R20]\]. In this study, we found that S5257 induced apoptosis was associated with increased telomerase activity and telomere elongation in HL60 cells. These results are in agreement with

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5258 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5258 is not known. In vitro studies indicate that it acts by blocking the action of the serotonin transporter (SERT) at concentrations that do not block the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or dopamine transporter (DAT) \[[@B2]\]. S5258 also shows high affinity for the α1-adrenergic receptor, the 5-HT~1A~ receptor, and the 5-HT~2A~ receptor \[[@B3]\].

The Phase II study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, crossover study conducted in healthy adult volunteers. In total, 24 subjects were randomized to receive either S5258 or placebo in three different treatment arms. In each treatment arm, subjects received two different single oral doses of S5258 (100 mg and 200 mg) and one dose of placebo on days 1 and 2. Subjects were given a 5-day washout

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5261 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5261 is similar to that of cyclosporine, with suppression of the immune system by binding to intracellular cyclophilin A, which is necessary for the generation of T-cell receptor--stimulated Ca^2+^ signals in T cells. S5261 does not bind to calcineurin or inhibit the enzymatic activity of calcineurin.^[@R7]^ The effects of S5261 on CD4^+^ and CD8^+^ T cells were similar. The dose-response relationship for the reduction of CD4^+^ T-cell count was linear, and the maximal reduction was approximately 60% to 70% at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day. S5261-treated mice showed no adverse clinical effects, and their body weight and food intake were normal. S5261 had no significant effect on the absolute numbers of B cells, macrophages, neutroph

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5267 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5267 is not known. However, the small molecule acts at the level of the HIV-1 transcription complex, and may bind to and/or interfere with the interaction of Tat and TAR, and thus disrupt the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. S5267 is not a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and does not inhibit HIV-1 replication in cell culture.
S5267 was initially identified in a screen for HIV-1 inhibitors based on its ability to inhibit Tat-mediated transcriptional activation. (O'Neill et al. J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 2821-2826). S5267 was shown to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of Tat function, and also inhibits the interaction of Tat with TAR RNA. S5267 inhibits HIV-1 replication in chronically infected T-cell lines and inhibits HIV-1 replication in cell culture. S5267 was found to have low micromolar activity in both in

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5268 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5268 is complex and has not been completely elucidated. The main hypothesis is that the inhibition of the conversion of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) into ACTH by S5268 reduces the synthesis of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), which may lead to a reduction of cortisol production \[[@B17]\].

However, the mechanism of action of S5268 has not been confirmed in humans. In a recent study by Tan et al., it was demonstrated that a single oral dose of S5268 at doses of 1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg did not affect the plasma levels of ACTH, cortisol, or β-endorphin in healthy volunteers \[[@B18]\]. Moreover, in another study, a single oral dose of S5268 at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg did not affect the plasma levels of ACTH or cortisol

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5273 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5273 is not known, but we have evidence that it induces the activation of human protein kinase C. This kinase is one of a group of enzymes that phosphorylate proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The role of this kinase in the mechanism of action of S5273 is not known, but a similar pattern of kinase activation has been reported for other steroids. Other studies have suggested that the induction of protein kinase C activity is one of the mechanisms of action of the antiandrogen, flutamide. In this study, we evaluated the effect of S5273 on the in vitro activity of protein kinase C. S5273 did not directly stimulate protein kinase C activity in a purified system. However, S5273 potentiated the activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5279 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5279 is based on a postulated binding of the C-terminal half of the DNA-binding domain of T-bet to a site of the promoter region of the *IFNG* gene (GSE28762, \[[@B21-ijms-20-00140]\]). The *IFNG* gene is transcriptionally activated by T-bet, and the C-terminal half of the DNA-binding domain of T-bet is important for the binding of T-bet to the *IFNG* gene. S5279 was synthesized as a C-terminal half-peptide of the DNA-binding domain of T-bet, and thus, it can compete with the endogenous T-bet protein for binding to the *IFNG* gene. The effect of S5279 was tested by a reporter assay. S5279 suppressed the *IFNG* gene promoter activity, but not the activity of the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5280 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5280 is related to the inhibition of GSK-3β and the phosphorylation of Tau protein at multiple sites, which promotes the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal apoptosis. As a result, the neuronal injury induced by Aβ1-42 in rats is alleviated, thus improving the learning and memory ability.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5281 is not fully understood. The agent has a greater affinity for HSP90 compared to HSP70 and may be able to block the interaction of HSP70 and HSF1, which could have implications for cellular stress response. In a preclinical study, S5281 showed antitumor activity in several human xenograft tumor models and showed promising activity in the treatment of hematological malignancies. S5281 is currently being evaluated in a phase I trial in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (NCT02166977).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5282 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5282 is still not known.

The drug, which is now in Phase II clinical trials, is one of several that could prove to be the next generation of cancer drugs.

As it stands, there are only two drugs in the United States that are used to treat colon cancer and they are both 5-FU and CPT-11.

The other major drugs in use are the anti-angiogenic drugs, Avastin and Zaltrap.

But the major drawback of these drugs is that they are toxic and there is no evidence that they actually improve the outcome of the patient.

In contrast, S5282 has been shown to be safe in mice and rats and, unlike the anti-angiogenic drugs, has been shown to actually slow the growth of the tumor.

That is a huge advantage, since anti-angiogenic drugs are only used in combination with chemotherapy.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5284 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5284 is currently unknown, but is believed to be a novel G-protein coupled receptor antagonist. The receptor subtypes for S5284 are unknown, but S5284 does not bind to any of the known dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, or acetylcholine receptor subtypes.

History

S5284 was discovered as part of a search for compounds with potential antidepressant activity.

Development

S5284 was discovered by GlaxoSmithKline during a search for novel compounds with potential antidepressant activity. It was tested in vitro for binding to the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine receptor subtypes, and also for activity at serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters. In vivo activity was assessed in rodent models of depression and cognition. S5284 showed no activity at any of the tested receptors, transporters, or ion channels.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5286 is yet to be elucidated. It is not known whether it interferes with any steps in the cellular replication of the virus, but S5286 may have an effect on virus-cell interactions and viral gene expression. These effects may contribute to the suppression of virus replication. S5286 was found to be well tolerated in clinical studies, and showed an excellent safety profile in patients.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5287 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5287 is related to its ability to inhibit p110α/p85α heterodimer and therefore has no activity against p110β or p110δ. In addition, S5287 inhibits p110δ/p85δ heterodimer more effectively than p110α/p85α heterodimer. These differences are likely due to the differential effect of the ATP-competitive binding mode of S5287 to the two catalytic subunits.

The X-ray crystal structure of p110α in complex with an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor has been reported recently [@pone.0026665-Kumar1]. The binding mode of the inhibitor is consistent with that of our proposed binding mode. A few small molecules have been reported to bind to p110α in the ATP-binding pocket. In addition to S5287, they include NSC-707, OSU03012, BAY 80-12

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5288 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5288 is believed to be through binding to the beta-tubulin, thereby stabilizing the microtubule and inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin dimers into microtubules. As a result, the normal mitotic spindle is disrupted and the cell cannot divide (See PCT WO 91/16320).
The clinical efficacy of S5288 has been demonstrated in several Phase I/II trials. S5288 has been found to be active against refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In a Phase I/II study of the administration of S5288 alone, patients with advanced malignancies (N=28) demonstrated disease stabilization for up to 18 months. Further, the administration of S5288 in combination with a standard cancer chemotherapy regimen was found to be well tolerated and was associated with an increase in the maximum tolerated dose of the chemotherapy (See U.S. Pat.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5292 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5292 is unknown. Inhibition of either PDE4 or phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in whole blood would increase the intracellular concentration of cAMP. As a result, S5292 would increase intracellular levels of cAMP, which would cause phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) by protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylated CREB binds to the cAMP response element on the promoter of target genes and stimulates their transcription. The target genes include adenylate cyclase (ADCY) and cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), which are involved in the production of cAMP.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5293 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5293 is as a prodrug, converting to a highly lipophilic derivative, which subsequently partitions into membranes where it is taken up by the membrane bound megalin/cubilin receptors present on the apical membrane of renal tubular cells, where it is metabolized and excreted in the urine. Megalin is also found on the luminal membrane of hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, where it mediates endocytosis of proteins from the blood and uptake of proteins and lipids from the intestinal lumen. Therefore, the selectivity of S5293 for tubular secretion over endocytosis may be important to prevent the potential side effects associated with accumulation of S5293 in the liver and intestine.

The most common adverse events (AEs) observed in the Phase 1 study were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. In Phase 2, the most common AEs were diarrhea (43.

A number of anti-inflammatory drugs that do not cross the blood brain barrier have been found to be effective in animal models of stroke, e.g. ibuprofen, indomethacin, piroxicam, and naproxen. (Kanno et al. 1995). The anti-inflammatory properties of these drugs, however, are associated with a number of undesirable side effects, including gastrointestinal ulceration, renal failure, and cardiovascular and hematological complications. These undesirable side effects have prevented the clinical use of these drugs.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5298 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5298 is currently unknown.

S5298 was selected for development from a series of thiazolidinedione derivatives. A study of the structure–activity relationship of the series revealed that the S5298 compound had the best balance of efficacy, safety and metabolic stability in a preclinical model of type 2 diabetes. The S5298 compound was well tolerated in humans and was orally active in a Phase 1 clinical trial.

A number of novel, dual PPAR-α/δ agonists have been reported to have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer. However, none of these compounds has been progressed to clinical trials. The current study investigated the efficacy and safety of the novel, dual PPAR-α/δ agonist S5298 in healthy volunteers.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5299 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5299 is believed to be through selective induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. In vitro, S5299 demonstrated antiproliferative activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines, including cell lines of breast, colon, lung, and ovary. S5299 is also believed to be effective in vivo against a variety of tumor xenografts in nude mice, including xenografts of human lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. S5299 has been shown to be effective in a number of xenograft models of human breast cancer, including MDA-MB-231 (Ernst et al., 2002, Breast Cancer Res. Treat., 69:103-113).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5311 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5311 is as follows. During the first 30 min of exposure to S5311, the liposomes are taken up into the cells, and the drug is released. However, as the cells continue to divide, they form larger and larger vacuoles. At approximately 3 h, the vacuoles become large enough to disrupt the membranes of the vacuoles and to release the drug. Thus, it is hypothesized that the drug is taken up into the cells and is released from the liposomes in the large vacuoles, causing the cells to die.

S5311 was synthesized as described previously ([@b9-ehp-118-1497]). Liposomes were prepared by a modified version of the method described by [@b17-ehp-118-1497]. Briefly, S5311 was dissolved in chloroform and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was then

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5320 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5320 is unclear, but it is possible that the change in charge of the drug is responsible for its effects. It is interesting that the relationship between *p53* and S5320 appears to be different between the two cell lines, and that there is a more potent effect in the T24 cells.

It is also possible that S5320 could be acting by a different mechanism. For example, it is known that the OATP family of transporters, particularly OATP1A2, is involved in the uptake of a number of anti-cancer drugs ([@bib16]). OATP1A2 is highly expressed in T24 cells and this may contribute to the greater uptake of S5320 in these cells.

S5320 is a well-tolerated drug in patients with cancer, and it has been reported to have low potential for drug--drug interactions ([@bib4]). In this study

Response: The mechanism of action of S5325 is complex and is mediated through direct inhibition of histone deacetylases, suppression of histone deacetylase activity and transcriptional upregulation of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as gossypol. The gossypol moiety is thought to cause cell death by interaction with the caspase pathway and caspase-independent mechanisms.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5327 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5327 is not known. The effects of the drug have been evaluated in vitro, in animal models, and in patients. In vitro, S5327 has been shown to inhibit the binding of human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to the alpha-fetoprotein receptor, which is found in the placenta and in hepatoma cell lines. In the animal models, the drug inhibits the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoma in a rat model and has been shown to inhibit the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in culture. The mechanism of action of S5327 has been evaluated in a clinical trial. S5327 was given to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, who had failed prior chemotherapy. It was well tolerated, and there was no significant difference in overall survival between the patients treated with S5327 and those treated with placebo.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5333 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5333 is as follows: S5333 is phosphorylated by PKB/Akt to form the phosphorylated-S5333 (p-S5333) peptide, which binds to VDR and causes VDR to enter the nucleus. In the nucleus, VDR activates genes involved in adipogenesis and inhibits genes involved in inflammation, thereby inhibiting the production of inflammatory factors and reducing inflammation in the body. S5333 is specifically used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions {#Sec12}
===========

This study identified a novel adipogenic agent, S5333, that has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Our results indicate that S5333 promotes differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes by upregulating the expression of adipogenic genes and downregulating the expression of inflammatory genes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5341 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5341 is similar to that of S1330, the main difference being that the thiophene ring in S5341 is substituted by an imidazole ring in S1330. In addition, S5341 exhibits higher binding affinity than S1330 to the ATP-binding site of the P2X7 receptor, which may be a potential explanation for the differences in the pharmacological profiles of the two compounds.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5343 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5343 is likely to be by binding to the amino acid transporter protein ATB^0,+^ (ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 0, a.k.a. SLC6A14) and blocking the reuptake of amino acids, resulting in the accumulation of the amino acids in the cytoplasm.

S5343 is well tolerated and has a good safety profile. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (38%), nausea (28%), headache (25%) and constipation (23%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were diarrhoea (4%), nausea (3%), constipation (2%), fatigue (2%) and vomiting (2%).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5345 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5345 is based on its binding to TNFα, thus blocking the interaction of TNFα with the TNF receptor. TNFα is produced by several cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, B cells, and CD8+ T cells. The TNFα protein is a 17 kDa protein and is encoded by a gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3). TNFα binds to two distinct receptors: TNF receptor I (TNFRI, p55, CD120a) and TNF receptor II (TNFII, p75, CD120b). The receptors are members of the TNF receptor superfamily, and have similar structures that include an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that contains the signaling pathway adapter molecules TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5350 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5350 is not fully understood. S5350 inhibits the action of the cell-surface protein platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) in human PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts. It does not inhibit the growth of several human tumor cell lines in soft agar. In nude mice, S5350 produces a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of human mammary tumor xenografts. It also causes an increase in tumor cell apoptosis and an inhibition of angiogenesis. In a Phase I clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of S5350 were assessed in patients with advanced cancer. The dose of S5350 used was not found to be toxic. It was also found to have an acceptable safety profile and clinical activity. S5350 is currently being tested in a Phase II trial for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5351 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5351 is not completely known, but is hypothesized to be related to its ability to increase the expression of the insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and the insulin receptor substrate 1 \[[@B39]\]. There are a number of other mechanisms by which it may exert its effects, including inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1, and dual specificity phosphatase-5 \[[@B39]\]. S5351 has also been shown to reduce renal angiotensin II, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α production \[[@B39]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5352 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5352 is likely to be through inhibition of a tyrosine kinase. In a study of the mode of action of imatinib, it was found that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor is a potent inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly those associated with oncogenic transformation (Cunningham, et al., Oncogene 19:5548-5557, 2000). The first kinase identified to be associated with the bcr-abl fusion protein was the bcr-abl kinase (Pellegrini, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:8894-8903, 1991). The bcr-abl kinase is the product of the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation of the bcr gene on chromosome 22 to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) on chromosome 9. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome is formed as a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5355 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5355 is similar to that of cyclosporin A (CsA). S5355 is an immunosuppressive agent, and inhibits T cell activation by inhibiting IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression. S5355 has the pharmacological activity of inhibiting CD4+ T cell activation, and inhibits IL-2 production by suppressing the transcription of the IL-2 gene and inhibiting IL-2 receptor expression. In addition, S5355 can inhibit the phosphorylation of the T cell protein tyrosine kinase, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).

Immunosuppressants, such as S5355, are used to prevent rejection after organ transplantation. S5355 is a novel immunosuppressive agent with the pharmacological activity of inhibiting T cell activation, and has been demonstrated to inhibit IL-2

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5360 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5360 is poorly understood.

The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the primary target of S5360 is the regulatory subunit of the type 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) ([@B18]). We propose that S5360 may be able to block the activation of the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α by activating the G-protein Gα12/13, which in turn inhibits the binding of PI3K to p85α.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5361 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5361 is based on an inhibitory effect on the hENT1, a nucleoside transporter of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) protein family, that is upregulated in various types of cancer. S5361 has been developed to inhibit hENT1 in the tumor cells, thus preventing the transport of cytotoxic nucleosides into the cells and inducing apoptosis. S5361 is a prodrug, which is converted into the active metabolite by the plasma enzymes. This drug is being developed for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that are resistant to standard therapies.

Tolerability and safety

The tolerability and safety profile of S5361 has been investigated in two Phase I clinical trials (NCT01046977 and NCT01103640) and one Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01046972). S5361 was generally well tolerated and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5363 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5363 is not known. Its metabolic profile is similar to other SSRI antidepressants with a short half-life and low oral bioavailability. It is a potent inhibitor of the serotonin transporter and a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor.

S5363 is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The active metabolite, S5368, is excreted mainly in urine.

Clinical trials
S5363 has been investigated in a number of phase II clinical trials in the United States. In these trials, it was administered as a single oral dose to healthy subjects and to patients with major depressive disorder. In a dose-ranging study, doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg were administered to each of three groups of 12 healthy subjects. In a single-dose study, 30 mg was administered to 20 subjects with major depressive disorder.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5366 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5366 is unclear. It is possible that inhibition of VEGFR2 or PDGFRβ signaling is involved in the mechanism of action of S5366, as both VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ are known to be involved in melanoma cell growth and metastasis ([@b31-ijo-50-06-1977]--[@b33-ijo-50-06-1977]). Furthermore, VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ are also reported to be involved in melanoma invasion and migration ([@b34-ijo-50-06-1977]--[@b36-ijo-50-06-1977]). However, further investigation is required to identify the molecular mechanisms of S5366 in melanoma cells.

In summary, the present study demonstrated that S5366 has significant antitumor activity against melanoma cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*. S5366 inhibited

Conclusion {#s5}
==========

S5367 is an inhibitor of Wnt signaling with anti-tumor activity against multiple tumor types. The compound has shown promising efficacy in a wide range of tumor models, including CRC, gastric cancer, HCC, and RCC. Clinical development of S5367 has been halted because of its toxicity profile. However, a novel formulation of S5367 is being developed to address the issue of toxicity and may be re-launched as an anti-cancer agent.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5368 is unknown, but is assumed to be related to interference with a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. The drug is highly effective in reducing the number of lesions, decreasing the size of the lesions and improving the condition of patients.

S5368 is available in a topical gel formulation and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe ichthyosis vulgaris in patients 1 year of age and older.

S5368 has been shown to be effective in patients with ichthyosis vulgaris, in addition to ichthyosis vulgaris with *SCN5A* mutations, and also in a patient with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5369 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5369 is yet to be established. Our data show that S5369 induced autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells. This is consistent with the published data by [@bib22], who demonstrated that S5369 induced autophagy in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, [@bib22] found that S5369 induced autophagy by increasing expression of Beclin-1. They also showed that S5369 induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, but we did not detect any effect of S5369 on apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, the mechanism of action of S5369 appears to be different in MDA-MB-231 cells. This is consistent with the observed differences in the effect of S5369 on the induction of autophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5372 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5372 is based on the blockade of hERG potassium channels and the resultant inhibition of action potential repolarization in ventricular cardiomyocytes. The potassium channels are expressed on the surface of cardiomyocytes and are responsible for the resting membrane potential of these cells. S5372 inhibits hERG potassium channels in a competitive manner and therefore has no effect on other potassium channels. The effect of S5372 on the hERG potassium channel results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential and thereby a reduction in the contractility of the heart. The reduction in contractility results in a reduction in cardiac output and the clinical effects of S5372 are a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure.
S5372 is metabolized to the active metabolite, S6426. S6426 is a potent inhibitor of the hERG potassium channel with an IC50 of 0.2 nM. S6426 is also a potent inhibitor of the inwardly rect

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5388 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5388 is based on the inhibition of the catalytic activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR. mTOR is an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family and it has been shown to be involved in the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, cell metabolism, and angiogenesis. mTOR is activated by its upstream regulatory proteins such as PI3K, AKT, and RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain). PI3K and AKT activate mTOR by directly phosphorylating TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2), a protein that negatively regulates mTOR activity. RHEB stimulates mTOR activity by inhibiting TSC2. The function of mTOR is strictly regulated by its multiple upstream and downstream regulatory pathways. mTOR exists in

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5392 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5392 is not known. It may affect the metabolism of the drug by the host, which may result in a change in the drug's PK and PD properties.

S5392 should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to cefditoren.

Caution is advised when coadministering cefditoren with ciprofloxacin, as the metabolism of cefditoren by the CYP3A4 enzyme system may be reduced, resulting in higher plasma concentrations of cefditoren and increased risk of QTc prolongation.

S5392 should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, as cefditoren is eliminated predominantly by glomerular filtration.

S5392 should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, as the metabolism of cefditoren is reduced in the presence of moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5393 is unclear, and so it may have several different mechanisms of action. It is likely that S5393 is a selective A~2A~R agonist, but this has not been proven. The lack of selectivity is reflected in the effect on cAMP levels in the striatum. It is possible that S5393 acts by increasing A~2A~R signalling to the cAMP-signalling cascade, as has been demonstrated for other A~2A~R agonists. Alternatively, it is possible that S5393 may be acting via a different mechanism, such as modulation of presynaptic glutamate release. As S5393 increased the extracellular concentration of adenosine in the striatum, it is likely that this is the mechanism of action of S5393. Further research is required to clarify the mechanism of action of S5393.

In conclusion, S5393 is a selective A~2A~

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5394 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5394 is thought to be through selective inhibition of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) and modulation of calcium flux. The IP3R is a calcium channel, which is a member of the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) family of calcium channels. IP3R is a calcium channel and it is activated by IP3, a secondary messenger.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5395 is unknown. As with other antipsychotics, S5395 may reduce the risk of death in patients with schizophrenia. However, whether the risk of death in patients with schizophrenia is increased or decreased is not known.

Treatment with S5395 may cause severe hyperglycemia and should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.

S5395 is not recommended for use in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential. The long-term effects of S5395 on a developing fetus are not known.

S5395 is contraindicated in patients with an unstable cardiovascular condition, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or a history of ventricular tachycardia. S5395 may exacerbate cardiovascular disease.

S5395 is not recommended in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to clozapine or its metabolites.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5397 is unknown. S5397 did not inhibit *in vitro* the growth of mouse T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 ([Figure S4](#pone.0064313.s004){ref-type="supplementary-material"}), or the growth of the mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 (data not shown).

The expression of all the MHC class I and II molecules was not affected by S5397 treatment ([Figure 4](#pone-0064313-g004){ref-type="fig"}). This observation is consistent with the fact that S5397 does not inhibit TCR-induced activation of human and mouse T cells [@pone.0064313-Rui1].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5398 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5398 is not yet understood. A recent study suggested that S5398 is able to inhibit protein translation through the downregulation of eIF4E, a cap-binding protein involved in the initiation of protein translation.^[@bib24]^ This was evidenced by the observation that eIF4E expression is increased in a dose-dependent manner after S5398 treatment.^[@bib24]^ In addition, we observed a decrease in protein translation after S5398 treatment by using a global proteomic approach in a human cell line (A549).^[@bib25]^ However, these results have to be confirmed in primary cells. Another hypothesis is that S5398 could be a substrate of CYP3A4, a drug-metabolizing enzyme, and therefore an inducer of CYP3A4.^[@bib26]^

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5399 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5399 is a mystery.

The substance works by a process called "succinate receptor antagonism" (SRO).

A 2009 study found S5399 was more effective at inhibiting L-form than E. coli.

According to the journal of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not reviewed the substance.

The FDA is working on developing a list of regulated products that are natural, and has reviewed the scientific evidence for four natural products (listed below) but has not yet released a final list.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, with many alleging that S5399 causes miscarriage, and is a "fertilizer" that can cause cancer.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5402 is based on a phosphorylation event, and it has been suggested that this may occur by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases. In particular, S5402 may inhibit Cdk2 and Cdk4.
In vitro, S5402 has been shown to inhibit proliferation of human lymphoid cell lines, in particular Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. In vivo, S5402 has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in nude mice.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5403 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5403 is unknown, but it is likely to be a modulator of the transcription of tumor suppressor genes, since it inhibits transcription of wild-type and mutant p53 in vitro, but does not affect p53 protein levels.

S5403, as a novel synthetic analog of spirocyclic piperidine and piperazine compounds, has been shown to inhibit the transcription of mutant p53 in vitro, but it is unknown whether this inhibition is related to p53-dependent transcription, as it has been described for other small molecules.^[@bib26]^ We hypothesized that S5403 is likely to inhibit transcription of p53 through a transcription factor-dependent mechanism. Indeed, the transcriptional activation of p53 is dependent on the transcription factor p300, which interacts with the transactivation domain of p53,^[@bib27]^ and its interaction with p53 is required for p53-dependent transcription.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5404 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5404 is believed to be due to its ability to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 3A4 enzyme. CYP450 3A4 is a liver enzyme involved in the metabolism of approximately 30% of the drugs currently available.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The oral bioavailability of S5404 is greater than 80%. S5404 is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and reaches maximum plasma concentration within 1 hour.

Distribution

S5404 is widely distributed in all body tissues.

Metabolism

S5404 is metabolized by the liver. S5404 is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 3A4 enzyme. S5404 is metabolized to N-desmethyl S5404.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5405 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5405 is to promote the secretion of endogenous hormones. It is believed that the action of S5405 is mainly through stimulating the release of endogenous oestrogen, as it is known that S5405 is an oestrogen receptor agonist. S5405 is the same molecule as the 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), which is the active component of many oral contraceptives. It is believed that EE2 exerts its contraceptive action by binding to the oestrogen receptor (ER) in the cell nucleus, which causes the cell to increase its production of oestrogen. This results in a thickening of the endometrium and, in the case of women with an oestrogen dependent tumour, a stimulation of the growth of the tumour.

S5405 is an oral contraceptive with an oestrogen agonist activity and is available in a combination of oestrogen and progestogen (triphasic).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5407 is

In the first in vitro study, S5407 was found to inhibit both transcription and translation of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.3 μM. This concentration was much lower than the EC50 of the protease inhibitors, such as telaprevir (9.2 μM) and boceprevir (12.3 μM). These findings suggested that S5407 may act at an earlier step than other protease inhibitors[@b34]. S5407 also had antiviral activity against HCV replicon cells with an EC50 of 0.6 μM. When this compound was administered to a mouse model of hepatitis C infection, it inhibited viral RNA levels in the liver by up to 100-fold. S5407 had no significant toxicity at any

S5408 has been shown to decrease prostate volume and to increase urinary flow in a rat model of prostate hyperplasia.

S5408 is under development by OncoResponse Pharmaceuticals Inc. (US) and Antares Pharma (Canada) for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5410 is likely to be different from that of other PDE5 inhibitors in that it does not seem to stimulate the cGMP-dependent protein kinase or to inhibit the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, S5410 did not affect the cGMP- or cAMP-dependent accumulation of cGMP in the vasculature or the aorta. The compound also did not appear to inhibit phosphodiesterase, and no changes in cyclic nucleotide levels were observed in aortic smooth muscle after incubation with S5410.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5411 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5411 is unknown, but there is evidence that the DNA binding domain of S5411 and perhaps other ligands may be related to the major mechanism of action of the gyrase inhibitor, novobiocin. The drug binds to the A subunit of the gyrase enzyme, which is responsible for supercoiling of DNA and has been implicated in controlling DNA replication and cell division.

Mechanism of action
S5411 acts by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an enzyme which relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA by introducing positive supercoils, the same type of DNA supercoiling that is introduced by gyrase. The mechanism of action of S5411 is unknown.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5412 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5412 is a significant difference between S5412 and the other lysosomal acid lipase inhibitors. The mechanism of action of these inhibitors has been well-characterized. Lysosomal acid lipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in the lysosome. Its absence or dysfunction results in accumulation of triglycerides in lysosomes. S5412 works by inhibiting the activity of the lysosomal acid lipase, thereby preventing triglycerides from accumulating in the lysosome and resulting in a reduction of fat accumulation in tissues. S5412 is therefore a lysosomal acid lipase inhibitor. In contrast, the other lysosomal acid lipase inhibitors work by blocking the activity of the enzyme, preventing it from binding to lipids and preventing the accumulation of triglycerides.

The mechanism of action of S5412 is significant because it is the first oral drug that specifically targets the lysos

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5413 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5413 is based on the capability of this molecule to stimulate the production of new vessels from pre-existing ones. It has been demonstrated that VEGF plays a key role in the process of angiogenesis. The VEGF signal, through VEGFR-2, stimulates the endothelial cells to produce the pro-angiogenic factors and to promote the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. These factors, in turn, stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. In fact, the VEGF family of molecules is the most potent known endothelial cell mitogen and a primary mediator of vascular permeability.
S5413 has a dual effect on the VEGF signal. It is a competitive inhibitor of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 interaction. S5413 binds to VEGF, preventing it from binding to the VEGFR-2 receptor and from activating the receptor. The molecule is also able to compete with

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5416 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5416 is not fully understood. It has been suggested that S5416 inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which is involved in the de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. This inhibition of IMPDH causes a reduction in guanosine nucleotide levels, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication and virus-induced cell death (Welch, P. et al. Biochemistry, 36:11587-11593 (1997)).
In addition to its activity against HIV-1, S5416 also inhibits the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Conze, B. et al. J. Virol. 74:9090-9095 (2000); Di Bisceglie, A. et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 45:2436-2441 (2001)).

Response: The mechanism of action of S5418 is similar to that of the SSRIs.  The pharmacokinetics of S5418 have been found to be dose-dependent, with a t1/2 of approximately 9 hours.  A Phase I trial in humans found the drug to be safe, well-tolerated, and pharmacokinetically active at doses up to 6 mg/kg.  A Phase II clinical trial is currently underway in Europe and the US.

In 2012, a Phase III trial was completed in Australia, comparing S5418 to paroxetine.  This trial found S5418 to be statistically superior to paroxetine in reducing the number of depressive episodes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5420 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5420 is unclear and it may be that S5420 works by preventing calcium channel protein reuptake or interfering with calcium binding to calcium channels. It may also be that S5420 is inhibiting intracellular Ca^2+^ release, as suggested by a recent study which demonstrated that S5420 inhibited calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a dose-dependent manner ([@B18]). A third possible mechanism is that S5420 might prevent voltage-dependent Ca^2+^ influx.

S5420 also has important advantages over traditional calcium channel blockers, such as nicardipine.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5424 is still unknown. It has been speculated that S5424 may inhibit or decrease the formation of the enzyme, thus reducing its activity and metabolism. The findings of our study provide a possible explanation for the toxicity of S5424.

It is difficult to compare the experimental results of our study with the results of other studies because the cells used in our study are different from the cells used in other studies.

Our study demonstrated that S5424, a representative new generation PAF-AH inhibitor, could increase the intracellular levels of PAF-AH and PAF. The upregulation of PAF-AH was associated with the increase of LPA production. The upregulation of LPA increased the activity of PKC.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5428 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5428 is thought to be related to the ability of the molecule to induce the phosphorylation of serine residues in the C-terminal region of p53. p53 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes that control cell cycle progression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Many of these functions are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which modulate the activity of p53. In addition to its effects on the p53 pathway, S5428 has also been shown to inhibit the activity of EGFR and the phosphorylation of the EGFR substrate ERK.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5430 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5430 is mediated by the depletion of extracellular levels of ATP. In contrast, P2Y~11~ agonists activate cAMP synthesis and, thus, increase intracellular levels of cAMP. cAMP then activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor CREB. CREB translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. CREB can also interact with other transcription factors to regulate gene transcription.

The reduction in extracellular ATP by S5430 has been shown to have antinociceptive effects in mice, rats, and guinea pigs. However, the results are species-specific, and the effect of S5430 is reversed by the coadministration of a P2Y~11~ antagonist. Furthermore, the effect of S5430 is reversed by administration of an adenosine A~1~ receptor antagonist, which suggests that S54

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5433 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5433 is as follows. S5433 binds to the gp130 receptor and activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which leads to the expression of genes involved in the proliferation and survival of liver cancer cells.

S5433 showed a high affinity for the gp130 receptor, and its binding was significantly inhibited by the preincubation of the gp130 receptor. These results indicated that S5433 specifically bound to the gp130 receptor. The EC~50~ value of S5433 for the gp130 receptor was 1.55 nmol/L, which is close to the EC~50~ value for the JAK2 receptor (1.34 nmol/L) and higher than the EC~50~ value for the JAK1 receptor (0.88 nmol/L). The EC~50~ value of S5433 for the gp130 receptor was 2.36 nm

Response: The mechanism of action of S5435 is not known, but it is thought to be due to its ability to increase the permeability of the glial cell membrane. The result is increased movement of calcium and potassium ions into the cell, which in turn activates the intracellular phosphorylation of proteins.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5440 is thought to be related to the inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression, proliferation, and cell survival, and to be involved in the progression of several types of cancers. In this study, we show that S5440 inhibits the growth of glioblastoma cells through the suppression of MAPK activity, without affecting cell viability or proliferation. S5440 induces apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway, and downregulates anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and survivin, and increases the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and p53. Furthermore, we show that S5440 inhibits cell migration and invasion, and the expression of mesenchymal markers, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Slug, but upregulates the expression of the epithelial marker E

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5454 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5454 is similar to the mechanism of action of other HIV integrase inhibitors (IIs) such as raltegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir. In the presence of the HIV integrase enzyme, S5454 is incorporated into the HIV DNA strand, leading to strand breakage. In the presence of human DNA polymerase, S5454 is further incorporated into the human DNA strand. The resulting strand breakage results in a block of HIV DNA replication.

Pharmacokinetics

The anticholinergic properties of S5457 may be useful in the treatment of bladder hyperactivity. It is thought that anticholinergic properties may be responsible for the reduction of urinary frequency and nocturia. The antimuscarinic properties of S5457 may be useful in the treatment of overactive bladder. In the presence of detrusor overactivity, S5457 may be useful in the treatment of detrusor hyperreflexia. S5457 may also be useful in the treatment of conditions associated with increased urethral resistance such as benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Approximately 3% of women are affected by overactive bladder, which is defined as a symptom complex of frequency, urgency and nocturia. These symptoms occur in the absence of UTI or other pathology. Overactive bladder is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5466 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5466 is not known. S5466 appears to have potent anti-angiogenic properties as measured by the proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in vitro. It also appears to inhibit the growth of solid tumours in mice when given intravenously.

It was first discovered by Dr. Stephen R. Friend, while working for the Merck Research Laboratories. Dr. Friend was a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and was an expert in the synthesis and biological evaluation of anti-angiogenic compounds.

Mechanism of action
S5466 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) tyrosine kinase, and is the most potent and selective FGFR1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development.

S5466 is not known to inhibit any other receptor tyrosine kinases

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5477 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5477 is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of S5477 action in human gastric cancer cells. We examined the effects of S5477 on the cell cycle and apoptosis in AGS human gastric cancer cells. S5477 inhibited AGS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The number of AGS cells in S phase was increased after exposure to S5477. Flow cytometric analysis showed that S5477 induced AGS cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that S5477 increased the expression of Bax and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 in AGS cells. S5477 induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax and decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 in AGS cells. These results suggest that S5477 may be a potential anti-cancer agent for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5480 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5480 is complex, and the evidence is inconclusive as to which receptor subtype(s) it acts on. S5480 binds to the muscarinic receptors, but also to the histamine H1 receptor, and may also act as an antagonist at the 5-HT3 receptor. S5480 has been shown to be more potent as an antagonist of the muscarinic receptors in vitro than in vivo, and has a more favourable profile in vivo than the reference compound atropine. S5480 was found to be well tolerated in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, single doses of S5480 (1–16 mg) were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were observed at the doses studied.

The pharmacokinetics of S5480 have been studied in both healthy volunteers and patients. S5480 has a long half-life of approximately 8 hours. S5480 is metabolised by dem

Response: The mechanism of action of S5481 is not well understood. The most likely explanation for the dose-dependent enhancement of the anticonvulsant activity of S5481 is an increase in the brain penetration of S5481. However, it is also possible that the anticonvulsant activity of S5481 is mediated through a different mechanism than that of S5481.

The mechanisms by which these compounds exert their effects on the CNS are not known. It is possible that S5481 interacts with receptors or transporters involved in the distribution and elimination of benzodiazepines in the brain.

Treatment of anxiety

A phase II clinical trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of S5481 for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5482 is not yet fully understood. This paper suggests that the anti-tumor effects of S5482 may be mediated by the following: (1) inhibition of growth of tumor cells and their metastasis by inducing apoptosis; (2) inhibition of growth of tumor cells by blocking tumor angiogenesis; (3) inhibition of metastasis of tumor cells by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to extracellular matrix. This drug is currently in phase I/II clinical trial for treatment of gastric cancer. The effect of S5482 on human melanoma cells was studied using MTT assay. This paper demonstrates that S5482 is cytotoxic to human melanoma cells in vitro. This compound has the potential to be used for treatment of human melanoma.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5488 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5488 is not fully understood. Since S5488 inhibits topoisomerase I, it is reasonable to assume that S5488 might also inhibit the interaction between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in the observed S5488-induced DNA damage. However, there is no direct evidence showing that S5488 could directly interact with DNA. We also tested the interaction of S5488 with DNA using gel retardation assays. The results showed that S5488 did not interact with DNA ([Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}).

We found that S5488 caused a time-dependent increase in DNA damage, and S5488-induced DNA damage was still evident at 48 h post treatment. This suggested that S5488 might cause DNA damage at an early time point and then lead to DNA damage accumulation. We also found that the DNA damage induced by S5488 was localized in the nucleus.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5491 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5491 is unknown. Although its precise mode of action in vivo is still unclear, its antitumor activity appears to be mediated by the induction of apoptosis and G1-phase arrest. The antitumor activity of S5491 in vivo was dependent on p53. S5491 showed high efficacy against a variety of human tumor xenografts. Its combination with cisplatin showed greater efficacy than cisplatin alone in the treatment of human ovarian cancer. This agent may have clinical activity against various solid tumors, especially in combination with other drugs.

Abstract

S5491 is a novel camptothecin analogue that is effective in the treatment of human cancer. The precise mode of action of S5491 in vivo is unknown. However, its antitumor activity appears to be mediated by the induction of apoptosis and G1-phase arrest. The antitumor activity of S5491 in vivo was dependent on p53.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5492 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5492 is different from that of BAY61-3606, a known small molecule HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) ([@B1]). It was previously shown that BAY61-3606 is a potent and specific HDAC inhibitor with excellent anti-tumor activity *in vitro* and *in vivo* ([@B1],[@B2]). BAY61-3606 selectively inhibited the enzymatic activity of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6, but did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of other protein deacetylases such as sirtuin 1, sirtuin 2, and/or sirtuin 3 ([@B1]).

Recently, several clinical trials of HDACi for the treatment of human cancers have been completed or are ongoing, and the results of these trials have been reported. The most encouraging results were obtained with SAHA, an HDACi currently used in the clinic

Pharmacokinetics

In vitro studies

In vitro studies have demonstrated that S5493 has potent inhibitory activity against P-gp, MRP2, BCRP, and OATP1A2. The compound is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, and is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9.

The potential for QTc prolongation has been evaluated in vitro using the hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) assay. The drug has been shown to have no effect on the hERG channel, but the drug may prolong the QT interval via other mechanisms.

In vivo studies

In vivo studies have demonstrated that S5493 is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 1–2 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/

Response: The mechanism of action of S5496 is as yet unknown. This can be addressed through in vitro and in vivo studies and will require the synthesis of analogues to assess which functional group is important for activity. S5496 was found to be active in a murine model of disseminated cryptococcosis (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type="fig"}). The survival time of mice was prolonged when S5496 was administered at the time of infection. S5496 has the potential to be developed as an antifungal agent for the treatment of cryptococcosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5499 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5499 is not fully understood, but the development of this drug provides a foundation for the discovery of more effective anti-angiogenic agents for the treatment of cancer. The mechanism of action of S5499 appears to be related to the inhibition of VEGF, and this mechanism of action is likely to be similar to that of the other VEGF inhibitors. S5499 was well tolerated in the phase I study. Most of the toxicities observed were of the expected pattern for a drug that is inhibiting a receptor tyrosine kinase, and were similar to those observed with other anti-angiogenic agents.

The VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKIs) are one of the most important classes of anti-angiogenic agents currently in development. These agents are currently in phase III clinical trials for a variety of solid tumors, and some of them have been approved for the treatment of cancer

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5500 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5500 is as follows: after oral administration, S5500 is absorbed and undergoes hydrolysis in the intestinal tract, yielding S3501 and S5502. S5502 is a stable and potent inhibitor of sEH and is rapidly metabolized into S3501, which has a similar potency to S5502.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5506 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5506 is based on the principle of immunostimulation, as demonstrated by the study of the immunological profile of S5506-treated animals. Indeed, S5506 was able to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in response to a bacterial antigen (LPS). The ability of S5506 to modulate the production of cytokines was assessed by the differential expression of CD80, CD86, and CD40 molecules on DCs. Moreover, S5506 stimulated the proliferation of lymphocytes, with a similar profile to that of the LPS mitogen Con A. These results demonstrated that S5506 induces the maturation of DCs and the proliferation of lymphocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that S5506 induces an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and in the production of IFN

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5507 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5507 is likely to be multifactorial and include alterations in cellular metabolism and signalling pathways. We previously demonstrated that S5507 inhibits the growth of several cancer cell lines and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This was achieved by inhibition of Akt and ERK signalling, which leads to the downregulation of Bcl-2 and the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In this study, we further investigated the underlying mechanism of S5507-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that S5507 inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, 4EBP1 and S6 in the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line, CEM-C7, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, S5507-induced apoptosis is mediated by a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-

This could block the growth-promoting signal transduction of FGF2 and hence cause cancer cell death \[[@B28]\].

Although FGF2 is generally accepted to play a major role in the development of pancreatic cancer, the molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. In our previous study, we found that FGF2 is expressed in almost all pancreatic cancer cell lines, but is not expressed in normal pancreatic tissue. In addition, FGF2 promotes the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and tumor growth *in vivo*. Knockdown of FGF2 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation, tumor growth, and the growth of metastatic tumor cells in the liver. We also

Response: The mechanism of action of S5509 is currently under investigation. It has been shown that the compound is effective against various types of cancer cell lines. The results from a panel of 10 human cancer cell lines were as follows: IC~50~ values ranged from 0.1 to 2.8 µM for leukaemia cells and from 0.3 to 1.4 µM for solid tumours (in comparison with imatinib mesylate IC~50~ values ranging from 0.1 to 3.5 µM and from 0.4 to 3.1 µM, respectively).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5514 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5514 is unknown. S5514 does not appear to have effects on transcription or translation. S5514 inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase and cGMP phosphodiesterase, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for S5514. In addition, S5514 has been shown to have effects on the contractile function of the bladder. S5514 has been shown to reduce the contractile force in isolated detrusor strips. This effect was seen at concentrations of 1-10 uM. The dose response relationship for S5514 was examined and an EC50 of 5.0 uM was calculated.
The compound of the invention is a potent and selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several diseases or conditions associated with abnormal levels of cAMP or cGMP in the bladder.
The present invention is directed to a method of treating a patient suffering from a disease or condition in which the abnormal

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5515 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5515 is not yet fully understood. In particular, the target of S5515 in the microglia, astrocytes, or neurons is not clear. To clarify the mechanism of action of S5515, we performed experiments using primary cultured mouse microglia and astrocytes and BV2 microglia and astrocytes. We found that S5515 induced a reduction in the intracellular Ca^2+^ concentration and the production of NO in BV2 microglia and astrocytes. These results suggested that S5515 directly suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes. However, S5515 did not affect the expression of TLR2, TLR4, and NF-κB in BV2 microglia and astrocytes. These results suggest that S5515 suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes through a TLR-independent

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5524 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5524 is not known. It was also shown that the addition of S5524 to the culture medium resulted in the decrease of the ratio of c-myc/GAPDH mRNA expression in PANC-1 cells and that the combination of S5524 and TZD (TZD and S5524 were both used at a concentration of 5 µM) resulted in the synergistic effect of cell growth inhibition ([Figure 1](#molecules-20-01179-f001){ref-type="fig"}).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5528 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5528 is not known, but it has been suggested that the mechanism of action is through the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation \[[@CR27]\].

S5528 is an oral, selective, potent, and selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) activity \[[@CR27]\]. In a preclinical model, S5528 inhibits the growth of human tumor xenografts that overexpress the EGFR, and it was well tolerated in mice \[[@CR28]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5531 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5531 is unknown. The drug binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and can block Ca^2+^ currents, which results in the reduction of Ca^2+^ influx and an increase in intracellular Ca^2+^ concentration. In contrast to other L-type Ca^2+^ channel blockers, S5531 has a distinct blocking action on a slow Ca^2+^ current. This may be related to its relatively selective binding to the cardiac L-type Ca^2+^ channel ([@B3]).

S5531 did not show any evidence of vasodilatation or hypotension in healthy volunteers, although the drug significantly increased plasma catecholamine levels ([@B7]). This may be explained by the relatively selective blocking of the cardiac L-type Ca^2+^ channel by S5531. However, S5531 has been shown to have some vasodil

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5532 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5532 is not completely clear, but the drug has a potential to be used as an anti-cancer agent for lung cancer. To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of S5532 in a pre-clinical animal model, we established human lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H460) and used them for the in vivo animal experiment. In addition, we also examined the anti-cancer activity of S5532 in human lung cancer cell lines, and in mice bearing human lung cancer xenografts. S5532 was orally administered to tumor-bearing mice once a day for 14 days, and the effects on tumor growth were examined. We found that S5532 effectively suppressed tumor growth and the tumor volume of the mice that received S5532 was smaller than that of the control mice that received saline. The body weight of the mice treated with S5532 was also not affected by the drug. To examine the mechanism of action of S5532,

In this study, patients were given S5533 (NCT00872470) by mouth once daily for 10 days. This study had three groups: a total of 72 patients were given placebo and 72 patients were given S5533. All patients were diagnosed with acute MI, except for one patient who had a diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris. This study was done at one medical center in South Korea. The mean age of patients was 59 years. The mean duration of MI was 7.4 days.

Overall, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the following:

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5534 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5534 is still unknown. One hypothesis is that S5534 activates AChE through a direct interaction with the enzyme or with a protein that is involved in the binding of AChE to synaptic membranes. Another possibility is that S5534 increases AChE activity indirectly through activation of other membrane-bound proteins. The effect of S5534 on AChE is dose-dependent. A low dose of S5534 (1 µM) activates AChE, whereas a high dose (1 mM) inhibits AChE activity. In this study, the dose of 1 µM was chosen as the optimal dose for the activation of AChE.

The most common adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, and increased urination.[@b19-ndt-11-715]--[@b21-ndt-11-715] The results

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5535 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5535 is unknown. We found that it caused a concentration-dependent decrease in intracellular cAMP levels, and its effect was similar to that of IBMX. However, S5535 had no effect on the increase in cAMP levels caused by forskolin. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of S5535 for the inhibition of cAMP accumulation was 10.2 +/- 0.7 microM. S5535 also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cGMP accumulation. The concentration-response curve of cGMP was biphasic, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 9.2 +/- 0.5 and 41.5 +/- 4.1 microM. S5535 did not affect the accumulation of [3H]cAMP and [3H]cGMP caused by isoproterenol, dibutyryl-cAMP, and NaF. These results suggest that S5535 may

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5537 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5537 is still unclear. It may be due to an increase in local blood flow in the peripheral vessels or a direct action on the tumor cells. It is also possible that the proliferation of the tumor cells is directly affected by the anti-angiogenic activity of S5537.

A recent study using FUDR and gemcitabine (a gemcitabine prodrug) in combination showed a synergistic effect against pancreatic cancer ([@b22-ol-0-0-5463]). The combination of gemcitabine and FUDR in pancreatic cancer is currently in clinical trials. Although FUDR is known to be an effective radiosensitizer, there are no reports on its effect on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5538 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5538 is believed to be a result of the interaction between the membrane and the lipid head groups, which is regulated by the acyl chain packing. This is caused by a preferential interaction of the hydrophobic tail region of the molecule with the lipid membrane. This interaction results in the disturbance of the lipid packing and in the loss of the conformational order of the membrane. The membrane order is characterized by the arrangement of the lipid head groups and by the distance between the lipid head groups. The order is expressed by the lipid head group tilt angle, the head group rotational mobility, and the head group separation distance. The extent of the membrane order is reflected by the NMR order parameter, the order parameter S. The NMR order parameter S is related to the dynamic behavior of the lipid head groups. A change in the NMR order parameter is reflected in the values of the chemical shifts of the lipid head groups, especially in the order parameter S31.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5539 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5539 is currently unknown. We suggest that, as with the steroid hormones, S5539 may interact with the androgen receptor (AR) to prevent the receptor from binding to the androgen response elements on the promoters of AR-regulated genes. Alternatively, S5539 may induce an alteration in the structure of the AR to prevent its binding to the androgen response elements.

The S5539 treatment of LNCaP cells decreased the expression of many AR-regulated genes and the AR itself. It is well established that androgen binds to the AR to stimulate the expression of AR-regulated genes, such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and TMPRSS2 [@pone.0044360-Takeshita1], [@pone.0044360-Kasahara1], [@pone.0044360-Kasahara2].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5543 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5543 is unknown, but its similarity to cilostazol is suggestive of its role as a PDE5 inhibitor. PDE5 is a member of the family of phosphodiesterases, and the actions of cilostazol are well described in the literature, as is the lack of clinical utility of other PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. It is thought that PDE5 inhibitors block the hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and thereby prevent the breakdown of the second messenger, which in turn leads to vasodilation, increased blood flow and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. The net result is to improve the symptoms of intermittent claudication.

S5543 was found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers, and its pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of sildenafil, a well-established PDE5 inhibitor. It is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5544 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5544 is as follows: After intravenous administration, S5544 binds to albumin in plasma, and then albumin-bound S5544 is distributed to the site of inflammation in the body via transcytosis of albumin-bound S5544 through the endothelial cells of the inflamed blood vessels. S5544 is incorporated into the endothelial cells and released into the subendothelial space, and then binds to various cytokines and chemokines released from the inflamed cells, including TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and MIP-1, which are the principal cytokines responsible for the inflammatory response in the body. S5544 is subsequently taken up by macrophages and lymphocytes, and then dissociates from albumin, which is a large molecule that cannot pass through the cell membrane, and is then released into the cytoplasm.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5546 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5546 is a complex process involving the initial binding of S5546 to the 5′-flap end of the DNA followed by cleavage at the scissile phosphate and DNA backbone resulting in the generation of 5′-hydroxyl and 3′-phosphate termini. The final step in the process involves DNA ligase binding and sealing of the nicked ends, resulting in the formation of a D-loop. A mechanism for S5546 was developed from the results of the biochemical studies described herein. It is shown that S5546 binds preferentially to the nicked, rather than the intact, DNA substrate. The DNA strand breakage activity of S5546 is a result of its ability to bind to the nicked substrate and, in the presence of ligase, to seal the DNA strand break. S5546 does not bind to intact DNA or to DNA in which the 5′-flap is intact. The formation

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5547 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5547 is to cause the reduction of p27Kip1, which leads to the inhibition of G1-S transition.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5550 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5550 is not completely understood, but its high affinity for the dopamine D~2~ receptor, and its ability to block adenosine and histamine receptors suggests that it is a competitive antagonist. In preclinical models of cocaine and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, S5550 was as effective as haloperidol and had a lower potency than risperidone. In studies of rotational behavior in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the medial forebrain bundle, S5550 reduced contralateral turning in a dose-dependent manner, but had little effect on the number of rotations in the 6-OHDA-lesioned side.

**Comments:** S5550 is the first compound in a new class of dopamine D~2~ receptor antagonists. Preclinical studies show that it has efficacy comparable to the established atypical antipsychotic risperidone and a lower potency than haloperidol.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5552 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5552 is not known. S5552 binds to a novel protein with the molecular weight of 120 kDa (120K) that is absent in the wild type (WT) NSC34 cells. The 120K protein is found to be colocalized with TDP-43 in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and to be present in both the healthy and degenerating motor neurons of SALS and ALS. The upregulation of the 120K protein is observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of S5552-treated NSC34 cells. S5552 upregulates the 120K protein, increases the levels of both α- and β-tubulin, and increases the acetylation of α-tubulin. Furthermore, the level of caspase-3, a proapoptotic marker, is reduced, and the level of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic marker, is increased in the S5552

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5556 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5556 is likely through the blockage of the ion channel pore. The compound is structurally different from other class III antiarrhythmic agents. Unlike class I and II drugs, it has no sodium channel blocking activity, but rather it inhibits cardiac sodium channels by interacting with a unique binding site on the cytoplasmic side of the channel pore.^[@bib1]^ However, the S5556 binding site on the channel pore is not involved in the gating of the sodium channel.

S5556 is currently under investigation in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5559 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5559 is via a Src family kinase (SFK)-dependent and PI3K-independent activation of ERK. Activation of SFK is involved in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated ERK activation and in cell survival. PI3K inhibition sensitizes cells to GPCR-mediated ERK activation. GPCR-mediated ERK activation requires PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of T410 in the C-terminal regulatory domain of Src. ERK activation leads to the activation of the transcription factor Elk-1, and expression of Elk-1 target genes.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5560 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5560 is to bind to the cell membrane and inhibit the formation of LPS-receptor complexes on the cell membrane. This reduces the inflammation response.

Efficacy in treatment of sepsis

In the early 1990s, it was discovered that S5560 had a positive effect on animals suffering from endotoxemia, and was later used as a treatment for sepsis. It was shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. S5560 was tested in a large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of over 3,000 patients with sepsis, of which only 4% survived in the placebo group. The treatment group had a significantly higher survival rate than the placebo group.

The anti-inflammatory effect of S5560 was shown in the first clinical study, which included 592 patients with sepsis. The patients were divided into two groups, one group receiving S5560 and the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5562 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5562 is based on the induction of apoptosis in transformed cells.

In this study, we found that S5562 treatment of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase. This result is in agreement with our previous observation that the Akt/p70 S6 kinase pathway is constitutively activated in B-CLL cells \[[@CR13]\]. Our results further demonstrate that S5562 induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells, as evidenced by cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9.

Although the detailed mechanism of S5562-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells remains to be elucidated, we can speculate on the possible mechanisms of S5562-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5564 is unknown, but its mechanism of action is not similar to that of a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor such as roscovitine. Roscovitine inhibits CDK1 and CDK2.

Pharmacology

Mechanism of action

S5564 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that regulate the cell cycle by activating or inhibiting cell cycle-associated proteins. CDKs are important for progression through the cell cycle, and their activity is tightly regulated.  In humans, CDKs are divided into two categories: CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, and CDK7, and CDKs 8, 9, and 10. The cyclin proteins that activate CDKs are called cyclins.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5565 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5565 is the result of a balance between proteolytic activation of a circulating enzyme, plasmin, and inhibition of its catalytic activity. We have previously shown that S5565 is a potent inhibitor of plasmin catalytic activity in vitro, and in vivo inhibition of plasmin activity results in reduced rates of fibrinolysis and reduced incidence of hemorrhage.[@b9-tcrm-12-861]

As an antifibrinolytic agent, S5565 has the potential to prevent the development of postoperative bleeding and other perioperative complications. As previously mentioned, bleeding is the most common complication of abdominal surgery and it is the leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality.[@b2-tcrm-12-861],[@b3-tcrm-12-861] S5565 could therefore be used as a prophylactic measure to reduce the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5566 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5566 is different from that of alteplase or its derivatives. S5566 directly inactivates PAI-1 by forming a covalent bond between a thiol group on PAI-1 and the carbonyl group on the active site of S5566. This covalent bond causes a conformational change in the PAI-1 molecule, thereby inactivating the PAI-1 molecule. The effect of S5566 is considered to be due to this covalent bond between PAI-1 and S5566. S5566 does not induce any conformational change in PAI-1 molecules.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5567 is as follows: S5567 induces cell death by an interaction with DNA in a p53-dependent manner, and this interaction is not sufficient to induce apoptosis. The activity of S5567 may be associated with the degree of DNA damage and a relationship with apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5568 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5568 is unknown. It is unlikely to be a P2Y~12~ receptor antagonist since this is a weak inhibitor of the receptor with an IC~50~ of \>10 µM [@pone.0053706-Alam1]. Other purinergic receptors have been implicated in the antiplatelet activity of S5568. It is known to have weak antagonistic activity at the P2X~1~ and P2X~4~ receptors [@pone.0053706-Alam1], [@pone.0053706-Hsu1] and weak agonistic activity at the P2X~7~ receptor [@pone.0053706-Bikou1].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5569 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5569 is related to the inhibition of the action of mTOR, which plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation \[[@CR28]\]. In this study, we have shown that the effect of S5569 on the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation is mediated by the inhibition of mTOR, and we have shown that S5569 inhibits the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP1.

Inhibition of mTOR is known to be involved in the induction of apoptosis \[[@CR29]\]. However, in this study, we did not find any changes in the induction of apoptosis in the A549 cells treated with S5569. We speculate that the mTOR-independent induction of apoptosis is related to the upregulation of p53 expression in the A549 cells treated with S5569.

In this study, we have shown that the inhibition of mTOR induces

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5573 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5573 is not yet understood. In an in vitro cell-free system, S5573 was shown to cause DNA fragmentation. In contrast, no evidence for DNA fragmentation was obtained in cultured human cells treated with S5573. In the same system, it was shown that S5573 caused cell death in cells that were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. However, S5573 did not affect the expression of cyclin B, and it was also shown that the cells were not undergoing apoptosis. Thus, the molecular mechanism of S5573 is not yet fully understood, but its cytotoxic effect is likely due to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase.

The mouse studies showed that S5573 was not toxic to normal tissue and was effective in the treatment of two xenograft tumor models. The efficacy of S5573 was also shown in a patient-derived xenograft model. In addition

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5581 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5581 is a novel and distinct mechanism of action from other approved therapeutics. As an inhibitor of kinases, S5581 specifically inhibits the kinase activity of JAK2, with little effect on the kinase activity of other JAK family members, including JAK1, JAK3, TYK2, and FLT3. S5581 inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK2 and its downstream substrates, including STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, and SHP-2. The potent and selective inhibitory activity of S5581 in the tyrosine kinase-dependent JAK2 signaling pathway provides the basis for its potential clinical application in the treatment of human hematopoietic malignancies.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5582 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5582 is still not fully understood, but its effects on the cytoskeleton may be related to its inhibitory activity on the Rho/ROCK/LIMK/cofilin signaling pathway, since this pathway is known to regulate actin polymerization and cell motility. A similar inhibitory effect on RhoA/ROCK signaling was observed in an in vivo model of thrombin-induced pulmonary thromboembolism, where S5582 decreased pulmonary thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner \[[@B71-ijms-21-02407]\].

A different way to control the cytoskeleton and actin dynamics is through the inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex, a complex of five proteins (actin-related protein 2, 3, 3-like 1, 2 and 5) involved in the nucleation of new actin filaments at the plasma membrane. The Ar

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5583 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5583 is likely to be similar to that of other α~1~ adrenoceptor antagonists. It would be predicted that the selectivity of S5583 for the α~1A~ subtype over the α~1B~ subtype would be due to the presence of the phenyl moiety at the 6-position of the 1,2,4-triazolo\[4,3-a\]pyridine core, which in other α~1~ adrenoceptor antagonists such as prazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin is responsible for a high degree of selectivity for the α~1A~ over the α~1B~ subtype. This is because the α~1A~ receptor subtype is coupled with G~i~ proteins, whereas the α~1B~ subtype is coupled with G~q~ proteins.^[

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5585 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5585 is similar to that of 5-fluorouracil. S5585 may act as a potent antimetabolite by blocking thymidylate synthase (TS), thereby interfering with de novo pyrimidine synthesis. This could lead to the depletion of dTTP, resulting in the accumulation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), which may lead to DNA strand breaks and cell death. However, the exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood.

Although several animal studies demonstrated promising antitumor activity of S5585, only limited data are available from human trials. The first-in-human phase I trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of S5585. S5585 was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (IV) at doses of 100 mg/m^2^, 150 mg/m^2^, 200 mg/m

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5588 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5588 is not yet fully understood. There are data suggesting that it could act on the 5-HT1A receptor ([@B26]) and/or the 5-HT7 receptor ([@B27]). However, it is also possible that S5588 interacts with a specific site in the NMDA receptor, since its structure has recently been described as an allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor ([@B28]).

The anti-stress properties of S5588 were confirmed in a rat model of acute stress induced by the restraint stress model. It was shown that, after 2 weeks of treatment, the S5588 group showed significant improvement in the stress-induced changes in locomotor activity, in body weight, and in corticosterone levels. These results suggest that S5588 can effectively alleviate the deleterious effects of acute stress on both the central nervous system and the periphery.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5592 is thought to be similar to that of dipyridamole, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. It has been shown to increase the concentration of cAMP in the platelets by inhibiting phosphodiesterase and preventing degradation of cAMP by adenylate cyclase. S5592 increases platelet cAMP levels and aggregation in response to ADP, epinephrine, and collagen. In the thrombocytopenic dogs, S5592 was administered orally once daily for 2 weeks. Platelet aggregation and blood coagulation time were measured. S5592 increased platelet aggregation in response to ADP, epinephrine, and collagen in thrombocytopenic dogs. S5592 also increased the plasma level of platelet-associated IgG. The thrombocytopenic dogs given S5592 had significantly higher platelet counts than the control dogs.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5594 is not yet known. The drug has been tested in vitro and in vivo in the laboratory and shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and have anti-inflammatory activity in animal models. This drug is a prodrug which is converted to the active drug (S5594) by the enzyme esterase.

Side effects

The side effects of S5594 are similar to those of other anti-platelet agents. S5594 may cause dizziness, headache, back pain, chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and constipation.

Adverse reactions that occur more frequently with S5594 than with other anti-platelet agents include allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and thrombocytopenia.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5597 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5597 is similar to that of vemurafenib and is therefore thought to be related to the inhibition of BRAF activity. The structure of S5597 differs from that of vemurafenib and sorafenib in that the sulfonamide is linked to the aryl moiety via a carboxamide group rather than a sulfonamide group.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5599 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5599 is still unknown, but its effect is not the same as nimodipine. It is possible that the vasodilator effect is not mediated through calcium channels. The binding of S5599 to plasma proteins was weak, and the percentage of unbound drug in plasma was relatively low. This suggests that S5599 is well distributed in the extracellular space. S5599 is metabolized in vivo to an active metabolite, which is also the major metabolite in the rat.

Nimodipine, a piperidine compound, has been widely used in clinical practice as a calcium antagonist. However, its long-term use is limited by side effects such as vasodilation, nausea, and dizziness.[@b5-dddt-9-2281],[@b6-dddt-9-2281] Moreover, nimodipine is metabolized by liver microsomal enzymes,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5601 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5601 is through suppression of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which regulates tissue growth and development. The protein kinase that phosphorylates Smoothened (Smo) on Ser 572 is Smo kinase (SmoK). This leads to inactivation of Smo and inhibition of Gli-mediated transcription of the Gli genes. SmoK can be activated by several factors including Shh, Gas1 and Fzd. S5601 can therefore inhibit both the canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling pathways.

S5601 is being developed for the treatment of various diseases including, but not limited to, cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, and melanoma. In addition, S5601 has the potential to be used in combination with other therapies to increase the therapeutic index and enhance the efficacy of these treatments.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5614 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5614 is different from that of zonisamide. The main effect of zonisamide is to block the voltage-gated sodium channels. However, S5614 exerts its effects through the binding to the 5-HT~3~ receptor and then causes an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, which results in the activation of phospholipase C, protein kinase C and protein kinase A, and the inhibition of the intracellular signal transduction pathway, ultimately inhibiting the depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane potential. In addition, the upregulation of 5-HT~3~ receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system may cause central effects, such as increased the anxiety-like behavior of rats.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5617 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5617 is through the suppression of STAT1 signaling, which leads to the inhibition of the Th1 response. These studies demonstrate the importance of the inhibition of STAT1 signaling for the treatment of SLE and Sjögren's syndrome.

The initial preclinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of S5617 in an animal model of lupus nephritis, as well as in an animal model of Sjögren's syndrome. As described above, the suppression of STAT1 signaling by S5617 leads to the inhibition of the Th1 response. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of S5617 is mediated by the inhibition of the Th1 response. The Th1 response is known to be an important component of the pathogenesis of SLE, and to be involved in the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome \[[@CR29]--[@CR31]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5618 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5618 is mediated by its inhibition of ABL1, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cell proliferation and survival. The activity of ABL1 is regulated by autoinhibitory mechanisms and its activation is tightly controlled by a set of inhibitory proteins. Among these, Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been identified as a critical protein to promote the activation of ABL1 in hematopoietic cells. Syk is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in signaling from cell surface receptors to downstream pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in B cells and Fc receptor (FcR) signaling in mast cells and myeloid cells.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5619 is not known. It has a very long plasma half-life (10 days) and is not metabolized by the liver. There is no known drug-drug interaction. It does not cause platelet aggregation, thus limiting the potential for thrombotic events. The product is formulated in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and can be stored at room temperature for up to 30 days. It is given intravenously as a single infusion.

For preclinical safety studies, S5619 is formulated in saline. In animals, the compound is given intravenously as a single dose.

There is no adequate and well-controlled human study of S5619.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5620 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5620 is thought to involve the suppression of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. It was suggested that S5620 is able to inhibit de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis through inhibition of the enzymes in the *de novo* pathway, dihydroorotase (DHODH), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and orotidylate decarboxylase (ODC). DHODH is the rate-limiting enzyme of the *de novo* pathway. The structure of S5620 is similar to that of naphthyridine-containing dihydroorotate analogues (e.g. zaragozic acid A and B) \[[@B26]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of S5621 is via modulation of E2F1 expression. The E2F1 gene is a direct target of p53 and is required for the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by p53 \[[@B29]\]. Therefore, S5621 might suppress tumor growth via induction of apoptosis.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not study whether or not the growth of human gastric cancer cell lines was inhibited by S5621 *in vivo*. Second, the present study was performed *in vitro*. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether or not the same findings can be obtained *in vivo*. Finally, we did not perform a long-term study, so it remains to be determined whether or not S5621 is toxic in the long term.

In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that S5621 has the potential to suppress the growth of gastric cancer cells *in vitro*. Therefore

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5625 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5625 is based on the idea that the high concentration of oxygen radicals present in the myocardium after ischemia can lead to the formation of an important lipid peroxidation product, MDA. This is a very reactive molecule, which can diffuse through the cell membrane and be incorporated into the intracellular membrane structure. Since this is a peroxidative process, the MDA incorporation can alter the activity of ion channels, especially those that regulate calcium channels, which could lead to an important increase in calcium influx. This increase in calcium influx can lead to a larger degree of contraction and to an increase in oxygen consumption by the myocardium. Therefore, the decrease in MDA levels observed in the myocardium of the animals treated with S5625 could be explained by the ability of this drug to reduce the myocardial oxygen consumption, as shown in previous studies in which it has been demonstrated that S5625 is capable of decreasing oxygen consumption by

S5626 inhibits PARP1 enzymatic activity by binding at the catalytic site, and this binding is independent of the auto-ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP1. S5626 is a potent inhibitor of PARP1 in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits PARP1-mediated cellular responses, including cell death and the activation of PARP1-mediated DNA repair pathways. S5626 has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of PARP1 in a number of different models of diseases including the treatment of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancers.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5627 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5627 is based on its unique ability to increase the bioavailability of statins and co-administration with statins should improve the efficacy of statins by increasing their bioavailability.

The clinical development program for S5627 was based on an exploratory Phase I trial, which was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of S5627 in healthy male volunteers. The study showed that S5627 was well tolerated with no safety concerns, and was able to increase the exposure of rosuvastatin by over 3-fold.

The Phase IIa study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of S5627 in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study that compared the efficacy and safety of S5627 to placebo when administered in combination with rosuvastatin.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5628 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5628 is poorly understood. A recent study has shown that it does not affect eukaryotic translation elongation factors, suggesting that S5628 may inhibit protein synthesis by blocking the translocation of the ribosome on mRNA \[[@B16-marinedrugs-15-00256]\]. However, the involvement of translation elongation factors has not been proven yet. Moreover, S5628 is also a potent inhibitor of the caspase-3 protease \[[@B8-marinedrugs-15-00256]\]. It has been proposed that the ability of S5628 to inhibit caspase-3 might be mediated by direct binding of the compound to the active site of the protease, thereby blocking its catalytic activity \[[@B8-marinedrugs-15-00256]\].

It is noteworthy that S5628 is also a potent inhibitor of proteasome

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5629 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5629 is based on its ability to block IKK2, the kinase that phosphorylates IκB, leading to the activation of NF-κB. This leads to the activation of inflammatory genes and also to the induction of the autophagy pathway, as previously described \[[@CR9]\]. S5629 may have an effect on inflammation and autoimmunity, since it reduces NF-κB activation, which is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response \[[@CR19]\]. S5629 also has a direct effect on the autophagy pathway, as indicated by its ability to increase the autophagic flux. S5629 was recently tested in an animal model of lupus-like autoimmunity. S5629 significantly reduced proteinuria, which was accompanied by a reduction in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as TNFα

Response: The mechanism of action of S5634 is not known. We observed that S5634 can stimulate proliferation of CD4+ T cells from spleen and LN. This was not observed in cells from peripheral blood. This result is consistent with previous observations of the proliferative effects of HU in human peripheral blood ([@B19], [@B20]).

In conclusion, S5634 is a novel immunostimulatory agent with potential for the treatment of various diseases. In addition, S5634 is a promising compound for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including SLE.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5635 is not yet fully understood. The first evidence of a role for eIF4E in RNA binding came from the observation that the 4E binding protein (4E-BP) could bind to eIF4E and block the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G ([@bib22]). Subsequently, a dominant-negative form of eIF4E that lacks a 5′-terminal methionine, designated eIF4E-ΔM, was shown to be able to compete with wild-type eIF4E for binding to the cap-binding protein eIF4G, but not for binding to the cap-binding protein eIF4A ([@bib19]). The 4E-BP-binding site in eIF4E overlaps with the cap-binding site, but the mechanism by which 4E-BP blocks eIF4E is not understood. The second effect of 4E

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5649 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5649 is complex. It is a potential anti-tumor agent and a topoisomerase II inhibitor. It is an analog of Etoposide, an active agent used in cancer chemotherapy. Etoposide has been shown to induce apoptosis and autophagy in tumor cells. S5649 is believed to act similarly to Etoposide and is effective in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, including lymphomas, leukemias, solid tumors, and others. The therapeutic effect of S5649 has been observed in clinical trials.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5650 is unknown. The target of S5650 may be a protein with a role in the regulation of the assembly or secretion of cytokines. The function of this protein could be regulated by a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. We speculate that S5650 might be a promising drug for the treatment of chronic inflammation.

Conclusions {#Sec17}
===========

In summary, we have developed a new and effective drug, S5650, which can significantly ameliorate the symptoms of chronic colitis in mice. The effects of S5650 are mainly related to its anti-inflammatory properties, rather than to its analgesic or anti-nociceptive effects. S5650 may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic inflammation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5652 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5652 is still under investigation. However, its primary target may be cancer cells and S5652 can be classified as a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This selective property of S5652 can be explained by the structure of S5652. The compound has a tri-substituted pyrazoline ring and a carbonyl group in its side chain. S5652 is designed to target specific tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and HER3. S5652 is a multi-kinase inhibitor, which can block multiple tyrosine kinases simultaneously. The inhibition of multiple tyrosine kinases can potentially inhibit cell proliferation and survival. In addition, the inhibitory effect of S5652 on angiogenesis has also been reported in previous studies \[[@CR15]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5653 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5653 is believed to involve inhibition of the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9, resulting in activation of GSK-3β and thereby inhibiting glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in the production of glycogen. This results in increased glycogen accumulation in the liver. Thus, the inhibition of GSK-3β by S5653 may provide the beneficial effects on hepatic glucose homeostasis seen in vivo in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and related disorders.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5657 is as follows: S5657 works by inhibiting STAT5, thereby blocking STAT5-mediated gene transcription. S5657 binds STAT5, inhibiting the formation of dimers and tetramers, thus preventing the STAT5-mediated transcription of target genes.

Pharmacokinetics

Bioavailability

S5657 was designed to be orally bioavailable. After oral administration of a single dose of S5657 to healthy male subjects, the area under the curve (AUC) for S5657 was approximately 5-fold greater than that of JAK2 and approximately 6-fold greater than that of the unmodified thalidomide. Peak plasma concentrations of S5657 are reached in approximately 1 hour, and the mean elimination half-life is approximately 4.4 hours.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5659 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5659 is related to inhibition of V-ATPase (Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}), a major transporter responsible for ATP hydrolysis in cells \[[@CR32]\]. Inhibition of V-ATPase leads to the accumulation of lysosomal Ca^2+^ and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) \[[@CR33]\]. The accumulated Ca^2+^ causes oxidative stress, and ROS are involved in DNA damage \[[@CR34]\]. Thus, S5659 may suppress cell growth through the production of ROS. Although the mechanism of action of S5659 is unclear, it is speculated that S5659 may cause lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of Ca^2+^ in cells, which is closely related to cell growth inhibition.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5702 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5702 is complex and remains poorly understood. There is evidence that S5702 directly induces apoptosis in tumor cells and inhibits angiogenesis and cell proliferation by targeting the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. It is known that the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are key regulators of cell survival, proliferation, and migration, and their activation is associated with tumor progression.\[[@ref14]\] The MAPK pathway consists of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and the PI3K/AKT pathway consists of the Ras/PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling cascade. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is activated by extracellular stimuli and regulates the expression of genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The Ras/PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling cascade is activated by intracellular signals

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5703 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5703 is not yet fully understood. However, the increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells was accompanied by an increase in caspase-3 activity and the Bcl-2 protein levels in the livers of mice after treatment with S5703.

S5703 is a novel small molecule and, to our knowledge, the first compound to induce apoptosis via the activation of the mitochondrial pathway. The proapoptotic effect of S5703 is different from that of TRAIL, and S5703 does not trigger cell death through the death receptors DR4 and DR5. S5703 does not bind to caspase-8 or the death receptors DR4 and DR5, but it activates caspase-3 and induces apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. In this study, the activation of caspase-3 by S5703 was accompanied by an increase in Bcl-2 protein levels and a decrease in Bcl-

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5705 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5705 is based on the inhibition of human thymidylate synthase (TS), the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the methyl group required for DNA replication. TS is the only enzyme in the folate pathway that catalyzes the formation of a 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate derivative from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and serine. The reaction is reversible and a methyl donor, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, is formed as a product.
The folate pathway is the major pathway for de novo purine synthesis. A decrease in folate levels results in reduced de novo purine synthesis, and can lead to cell death.
The compound S5705 inhibits the growth of human colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5706 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5706 is thought to be through its selective inhibition of TGF-β1 activity. However, the lack of TGF-β1 activity by S5706 has also been reported by others, which may be due to differences in experimental conditions (e.g. differences in culture media, media supplement and reagents). The lack of TGF-β1 activity has been attributed to a TGF-β1 dependent increase in S5706 concentration in the media. TGF-β1 induced proliferation of the murine B cell line WEHI-231 was shown to be inhibited by a TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody, whereas the proliferation of human leukemic T cell line CCRF-CEM was not. In addition, S5706 had no effect on TGF-β1 induced proliferation of the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, and no effect on the murine fibroblast cell line L9

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S5709 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S5709 is a secreted protein. This makes it a good candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The disease targets are a combination of genes, but the biggest problem is the delivery.

The body does not produce this protein. It has to be injected. The results of this trial were published in May 2013. The trial was stopped because it did not reach its primary endpoint, but the follow up study is ongoing.

There were a total of 1,432 participants who were randomized to the treatment and control groups. The participants were all patients with the hereditary disorder that causes Huntington’s disease, a progressive brain disorder. It is a rare disease, affecting only a few thousand people in the US.

The trial started in 2010 and it was stopped in 2013. The participants were followed for three years. The treatment group received the medication for nine months. The control group received a placebo.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5729 is similar to that of losartan, which is the most widely used antihypertensive drug in the world. However, losartan has the problem of a lack of long-term tolerability and is known to cause severe peripheral edema, which is a serious side effect in hypertensive patients. Thus, there is a demand for an antihypertensive agent with a novel mechanism of action which can replace losartan, or a derivative thereof, in hypertensive patients.

Response: The mechanism of action of S5730 is unknown.

History

S5730 was discovered by Eisai in 2006. It was in development for use as a medication for Type 2 diabetes. Eisai licensed S5730 from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in 2009, and the company was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2010. In 2011, AstraZeneca discontinued development of S5730 in the United States due to the development of SGLT2 inhibitors.

In 2013, S5730 was tested in a phase III trial for Type 2 diabetes. The trial was stopped in 2014, after a futility analysis revealed that the medication was not effective at lowering A1C.

S5730 was under development for use in Type 2 diabetes in the United States, but was discontinued in 2013 due to poor clinical trial results.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S8275-eFT-508 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S8275-eFT-508 is based on the delivery of a lipid-like core of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) which is a modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide and not a ribozyme. This is a different type of oligonucleotide from the mRNA and micro-RNA targeted oligonucleotides, and unlike the latter, the ASO is not degraded by RNAse H. The ASO in S8275-eFT-508 is 2′-*O*-methoxyethyl-modified. The effect of this modification is to reduce the degradation of the ASO in serum and increase its stability in cells, so that it is able to enter the cells and be taken up by the cell membrane. The ASO binds to the target mRNA and inhibits its translation. The S8275-eFT-508 mechanism of action is shown in [Figure 4](#fig4){

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9001 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9001 is likely mediated by its binding to a specific ligand-binding pocket within the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, which is identical to that used by the structurally related TK-inhibitor, sorafenib \[[@B8-cancers-12-01168]\]. While sorafenib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of BRAF and other kinases \[[@B24-cancers-12-01168]\], S9001 binds to a different pocket in EWS/FLI1, which may allow it to be more specific for EWS/FLI1.

Response: The mechanism of action of S9015 is through anti-angiogenesis. S9015 inhibited the secretion of VEGF, PDGF, FGF-2, and bFGF from both cancer cells and endothelial cells. This inhibitory effect on VEGF was in a dose-dependent manner and was more effective than that of sunitinib. S9015 also inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF and inhibited the adhesion of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF to the extracellular matrix, while sunitinib did not show this effect. In the xenograft tumor model, S9015 showed more potent inhibition of tumor growth than sunitinib.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9019 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9019 is very similar to the one of PAS: it interferes with the function of the N-terminal domains of ATM and ATR, thus preventing their interaction with other proteins (see Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). As a consequence, it prevents the activation of the cell cycle checkpoint kinases and, more importantly, it also impairs the DNA repair mechanisms. S9019 has a long plasma half-life, which allows to treat tumors that have become resistant to other DNA damaging drugs. Moreover, its oral bioavailability is high and it is not affected by food or the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. It is not genotoxic and it does not interfere with the metabolism of other drugs (see Table [1](#T1){ref-type="table"}).

Response: The mechanism of action of S9024 is poorly understood. It has been shown that S9024 inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells *in vitro* \[[@b14-medscimonit-23-3175]\], and has a higher affinity for the tumor cell membrane than the cell membrane of normal cells. It is possible that the intracellular signaling of tumor cells is more sensitive to S9024, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation. However, further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanism.

S9024 has been used as a monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer. The most frequent side effects include fever, rash, and anemia. The dose of S9024 used in this study was the highest dose ever used in a single agent trial. It was shown to be well tolerated in this phase I study, with no grade 4 or 5 toxicities observed.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9046 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9046 is as follows: S9046 is a strong inhibitor of microtubule polymerization. In the presence of S9046, microtubule polymerization is strongly inhibited, which in turn affects the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. The spindle is then unable to function properly, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells.

S9046 can be used to treat solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer, by inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. It is an effective anti-cancer drug, which has been used to treat cancers in China since the 1980s.

As shown in [Figure 5](#pharmaceuticals-09-00054-f005){ref-type="fig"}, S9053 was found to reduce Fyn kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, PP2 did not inhibit Fyn kinase activity at concentrations up to 100 µM \[[@B27-pharmaceuticals-09-00054]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9063 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9063 is similar to that of S911, which was shown to inhibit Akt phosphorylation by blocking its membrane translocation \[[@CR30]\]. However, S9063 has an additional methyl group on the benzimidazole ring compared to S911. As a result, S9063 binds more tightly to Akt, with a lower IC~50~ value, which may be attributed to the presence of the additional methyl group. The low activity of S9063 against PTEN may be due to its inability to bind to the hydrophobic cleft of PTEN, as previously reported \[[@CR31]\]. However, the activity of S9063 against PI3K was not examined in the present study. The effect of S9063 on the mTOR signaling pathway is currently being investigated in a preclinical setting.

Response: The mechanism of action of S9086 is unclear. It may have a synergistic effect with 5-HT, since we found that both 5-HT and S9086 increased the expression of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) mRNA in rat hippocampus. The 5-HT system is closely associated with the development of depression and antidepressant activity ([@bibr21-0269881114543719]; [@bibr27-0269881114543719]). It has been shown that the 5-HT~1A~ receptor agonist, buspirone, may be a more effective treatment for anxiety than SSRIs, due to the lack of somatic side effects ([@bibr7-0269881114543719]; [@bibr14-0269881114543719]; [@bibr24-0269881114543719]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9110 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9110 is likely to be different from other histone deacetylase inhibitors. In fact, the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor vorinostat showed a synergistic effect with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor ABT-888 in glioblastoma, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and reduction of angiogenesis \[[@B67-cancers-12-01034]\]. However, S9110 did not show any synergistic effect with ABT-888 in our cell lines, suggesting that S9110 and ABT-888 may affect different pathways to inhibit tumor growth. It is important to highlight that the combination of S9110 and ABT-888 resulted in an enhanced antitumor effect in mice xenografts \[[@B68-cancers-12-01034]\]. In addition, the combination of S

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9111 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9111 is unknown, but it does not seem to be the anti-inflammatory effect of S9111 that causes the improved symptoms in the RA animal model. However, it may be possible that the improved symptoms are due to other mechanisms, such as suppression of immune system, or the suppression of immune response to disease, or the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines production.

In summary, S9111 showed a better therapeutic effect in the collagen-induced arthritis animal model compared with celecoxib, and these findings were supported by the histopathological examination of the joints. This study indicates that S9111 is a promising agent for the treatment of RA.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9123 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9123 is not completely understood. S9123 could act on the mitochondrial metabolism, and may increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to apoptosis by changing the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis and the energy metabolism. In this study, we showed that S9123 suppressed tumor growth *in vivo* by suppressing the glycolysis of cancer cells. In addition, S9123 significantly suppressed the expression of GLUT-1, a glucose transporter, and HK-II, an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. Moreover, S9123 suppressed the expression of PFKFB3, which is a key enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. These results suggest that S9123 can suppress the glycolysis of cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of GLUT-1 and HK-II. The effects of S9123 were confirmed by the *in vitro* experiments using an orthotopic human pancreatic cancer cell line and a sub

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9140 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9140 is different from that of current PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. S9140 inhibits phosphorylation of AKT and S6, which are downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2, but does not inhibit phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E, which are downstream of mTORC1. The PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are effective in cancer cells, which are dependent on mTORC1, but not in normal cells, which are dependent on mTORC2 \[[@B38-cancers-12-02108]\]. Therefore, S9140 has the potential to be a new type of cancer-specific agent. S9140 showed the same level of anti-tumor activity as the positive control, everolimus, in PANC-1 xenografts and also inhibited the growth of PANC-1 cells in vitro. S9140 also

Response: The mechanism of action of S9143 is poorly understood. However, this compound is thought to inhibit the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the casein kinase II (CK2) \[[@B25]\]. In the present study, S9143 significantly decreased the *Pt*LDH activity, although the expression of *Pt*LDH mRNA was not altered by S9143.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9183 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9183 is currently under investigation in our laboratory. S9183 and its metabolites (pyridylpiperazine derivative) exert their effects on NMDAR by allosteric modulation of the glycine site. The concentration-response relationship was non-linear and was characterized by an increase in the apparent affinity of glycine for the NMDAR complex (E~MAX~ of S9183 was about 6 times higher than that of D-serine), an increase in the efficacy of glycine, and a decrease in the efficacy of glutamate. In the presence of D-serine, S9183 was as potent as D-serine at increasing the affinity of glycine for the NMDAR. In addition, the IC~50~ values of S9183 for glycine and glutamate were close to those of D-serine and L-serine, respectively. These results suggest that S9183 acts as an allosteric mod

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9200 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9200 is believed to be via the activation of the intracellular 5-HT~1A~ receptor. It is possible that the selective 5-HT~1A~ agonists may be more effective in treatment of depression and anxiety than S9200, which also acts on other receptors. For example, S9200 has been shown to act on 5-HT~2A~ receptors ([@b41]), and to be an agonist at the 5-HT~1B~ receptor ([@b37]). This has been proposed to be a cause of the anti-emetic properties of S9200 ([@b41]). Thus, although it may be true that S9200 has no intrinsic anti-emetic properties, it is likely that the anti-emetic effects are mediated via activation of 5-HT~1B~ receptors.

The present results support the suggestion that 5-HT~1A~ agonists are effective

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9212 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9212 is not completely understood. It is possible that S9212 directly inhibits AMPA receptors, as shown for the other mGluR2/3 antagonists, LY341495 and MPEP ([@B22]; [@B18]). Alternatively, S9212 may act indirectly, perhaps by inhibiting the presynaptic release of glutamate. For example, S9212 may affect postsynaptic receptors by altering the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), as shown for MPEP ([@B23]). Another possibility is that S9212 affects the release of other neurotransmitters, such as GABA.

The pharmacokinetics of S9212 are different from those of MPEP and LY341495. S9212 is an agonist of the mGluR2/3 receptors, and its activity is

Pharmacokinetic parameters of S9222 {#Sec15}
-----------------------------------

S9222 was well tolerated in rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg. S9222 was eliminated from the plasma of rats within 30 min after a single dose, and its plasma concentration declined bi-exponentially. The pharmacokinetic parameters of S9222 are summarized in Table [1](#Tab1){ref-type="table"}. S9222 was distributed into the liver and kidney with similar distribution volumes, and the half-lives of elimination in the liver and kidney were similar.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9224 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9224 is yet to be fully determined. However, a number of putative mechanisms have been proposed, which include (i) inhibition of DNA synthesis, (ii) induction of cell cycle arrest, (iii) induction of apoptosis, (iv) downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, and (v) inhibition of mitotic spindle formation. Our data support the hypothesis that S9224 downregulates receptor tyrosine kinases and inhibits mitotic spindle formation.

Receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Inappropriate activation of these receptors by mutation, overexpression, or ligand binding can result in oncogenic transformation and cancer ([@B9]). Inhibition of these receptors has proven to be a useful approach for the treatment of various cancers. S9224 is a potent and selective inhibitor of EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Previous studies

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9227 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9227 is to promote T-cell differentiation into cytotoxic T-cells by selectively increasing the expression of CD95 (Fas) in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. CD95 is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in apoptosis. In addition, CD95 plays a role in T-cell activation and differentiation. It is well known that CD95 is expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. CD95 ligand (CD95L) is a cell surface receptor that binds to CD95. The interaction of CD95L with CD95 on T-cells promotes the activation of CD95 and the subsequent induction of apoptosis in the T-cells. This mechanism is thought to be involved in the elimination of virus-infected cells, tumor cells, and auto-reactive T-cells.

ADM-114

S9240 is an orally available and non-competitive antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (IC50 = 5.7 μM) (Keramidas et al., 2013). It does not interact with other known nicotinic receptors, including the α4β2 and α3β4 receptors, and it has no effect on GABAergic receptors (Keramidas et al., 2013).

The safety of the patients treated with S9248 was monitored throughout the study and the investigators' overall assessment of the patient experience was positive. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar to that observed in the prior placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of S9248.

The incidence of patients experiencing treatment-emergent AEs was similar between the S9248 and placebo groups, and no new safety signals were observed. The most frequently reported AEs were related to the gastrointestinal system (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), nervous system (headache, somnolence), and skin and subcutaneous tissue (rash, pruritus).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9249 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9249 is based on a series of in vitro studies in which the cell membrane was disrupted by a combination of ultrasound and a surfactant. Ultrasound, used alone, is not effective for this purpose, but when combined with the surfactant the cell membrane is destroyed, thereby releasing cytoplasmic contents, including enzymes, proteins and free nucleic acids, which in turn activates the inflammatory process. In the initial phase of this process, oxygen free radicals (OFRs) are generated. These OFRs are generated in the cells by the action of superoxide anions (O2−), which are released by the action of enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), in phagocytic cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNs).
This process is accompanied by a strong release of proinflammatory mediators, such as histamine, cytokines and chemokines, which are involved in the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9263 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9263 is unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that the thiazolidinedione may function through its interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of transcription factors, which include PPAR-gamma. The PPARs are a subfamily of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and are key regulators of lipid metabolism. There are three subtypes of PPARs, namely PPAR-alpha, PPAR-beta and PPAR-gamma. Each subtype has its own specific tissue distribution and regulates the expression of specific genes in response to ligand activation.
Thiazolidinediones, which include troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are known agonists of PPAR-gamma. PPAR-gamma, also known as PPAR-g, is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which also includes the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9281 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9281 is currently unknown. However, several lines of evidence suggest that S9281 functions through the inhibition of ATM kinase. S9281 blocks the autophosphorylation of ATM on Ser1981 in human tumor cell lines. S9281 blocks ATM phosphorylation on Ser1981 in human tumor cell lines.

Response: The mechanism of action of S9326 is still unknown, but the SID5-dependent localization of the protein to the vacuole suggests that it acts in a vacuolar function or trafficking pathway.

S9329 was shown to be effective in an *in vivo* tumor model (colon cancer) in which it decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and the activation of Akt kinase, suggesting that the effects of S9329 on Akt kinase are mediated by a mechanism other than direct inhibition of Akt kinase. The Akt pathway is involved in several critical functions in cell growth and survival, and thus, there is a growing interest in developing drugs that can selectively target this pathway. The pharmacokinetics of S9329 in mice was investigated and a half-life of S9329 of approximately 3.7 hours

Response: The mechanism of action of S9338 is unclear. It has been shown to be active in various experimental models, including inflammatory bowel disease, in vivo models of experimental arthritis, and in vitro models of cytokine production. This broad spectrum of activity may be the reason why S9338 has been studied in numerous preclinical models of human disease. In addition to its potential role in inflammatory bowel disease, S9338 may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with increased levels of cytokines, such as cytokine mediated autoimmune diseases.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9344 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9344 is not known. S9344 has been shown to have an excellent safety profile in humans. In a Phase I clinical trial, the most common adverse events reported by patients receiving S9344 were diarrhea, headache, and nausea. Diarrhea, which was generally mild to moderate in intensity, occurred in more than half of the patients and was associated with the administration of S9344. S9344 is metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-gp and is a substrate of P-gp. Thus, caution should be used in coadministering S9344 with drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 or P-gp. No dosage adjustment is required for the concurrent administration of S9344 with drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 or P-gp.

S9344 is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9348 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9348 is not completely understood. A recent study showed that S9348 may act by promoting apoptosis in various cell types. This may be due to the activation of caspase-8 and/or caspase-3.^[@bibr13-1534735417734911]^

The next question was whether S9348 was cytotoxic to human tumor cells in vitro. S9348 treatment of HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activation and in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, while in MDA-MB-231 cells, S9348 treatment increased caspase-3/7 activity, but no significant change in cell viability was observed. These results indicate that S9348 is selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells but not to MDA-MB-231 cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9349 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9349 is believed to be as a GPR54 agonist, activating cell surface GPR54 and initiating intracellular signaling. See, for example, Lebib et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 280:37941-37946 (2005); and Dong et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 357:1033-1040 (2007)). GPR54, also known as G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPCR54) is a G protein-coupled receptor. GPR54 was initially identified in a screen for GPCRs that are co-expressed with the neuropeptide kisspeptin. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system is important for the regulation of puberty, reproduction and energy balance. GPR54 is also believed to be involved in the regulation of the stress response, immune response, and inflammation. GPR54 is expressed in the brain

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9351 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9351 is based on the upregulation of tumor-suppressive genes, such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), via epigenetic mechanisms and downregulation of oncogenes such as c-Myc, Mcl-1, and E2F1. The retinoblastoma protein is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and is commonly mutated in many human cancers, which leads to inactivation of this protein and deregulated cell proliferation. Therefore, reactivation of the Rb protein has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Here, we present an overview of S9351 and its potential therapeutic value.

Introduction

In the past few years, significant advances in the development of anticancer drugs have been made, leading to more effective treatments for patients. However, these drugs have several limitations such as lack of specificity and drug resistance, which are major obstacles in cancer therapy [1]. Therefore, the development

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9353 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9353 is based on inhibition of the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway. In fact, the antiproliferative effect of S9353 in primary AML cells was accompanied by inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr389 and Ser240/244, indicating that the drug was able to inhibit mTORC1 activity. This inhibition was associated with the downregulation of the key components of the mTORC1 pathway, such as the mTOR, S6K1, and 4E-BP1 proteins, suggesting that the mTORC1/S6K1 axis was a target of S9353. Furthermore, in the absence of an intact mTORC1 pathway, S9353 was able to induce apoptosis, which was associated with the activation of the mitochondrial pathway. This mechanism of action of S9353 was confirmed in the U937 AML cell line, which harbors a mutated *FL

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9354 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9354 is still unknown, but it is possible that the increased activation of PXR and CYP3A4 may be involved. A similar case of a known PXR inducer that resulted in a pharmacokinetic interaction has been reported for other pharmaceutical agents.^[@bib24]^ In this study, the metabolite ratio of S9354 was significantly decreased after co-administration of nifedipine. The effect of nifedipine on the pharmacokinetics of S9354 was small and was not expected to have clinical significance. Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP3A4, and it is possible that the decrease in the metabolite ratio was a result of inhibition of CYP3A4 by nifedipine. The metabolite ratio of S9354 is known to be affected by the CYP3A4 genotype.^[@bib25]^

Response: The mechanism of action of S9367 is unknown. This phase II study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of single-agent S9367 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

Abstract

OBJECTIVE:

The MCL-1 protein is an important regulator of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The development of small-molecule inhibitors of MCL-1 is a rational approach to targeting this protein in leukemia. This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the novel MCL-1 inhibitor, S9367, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9368 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9368 is to promote the destruction of senescent cells, particularly in the context of other senolytic agents, such as quercetin, and not simply through an increase in autophagy.

We have shown that S9368 induces autophagy and leads to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. This decrease in membrane potential was consistent with the presence of the autophagy markers LC3B-II and LAMP1, as well as an increase in the autophagy substrate p62. It has been shown that p62 is degraded by autophagy and that this is necessary for the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria ([@bib26]). In addition, we observed a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is consistent with the increase in apoptosis observed. It has been shown that S9368 is able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, and this occurs through the casp

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9373 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9373 is not known, however, in this report we provide some insight into the mode of action. The S9373-induced enhancement of colony formation in P388 cells was associated with the inhibition of the apoptotic process. To determine if S9373 could induce apoptosis in P388 cells, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of S9373 and the level of apoptosis was determined by the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit. As shown in [Figure 1](#f1-ijms-11-03322){ref-type="fig"}, S9373 induced a concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9380 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9380 is not well understood, but is likely to involve increased Ca^2+^-induced Ca^2+^ release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thus increased Ca^2+^ influx through L-type Ca^2+^ channels. In fact, S9380 has been shown to increase intracellular Ca^2+^ in myocytes and in neurons ([@B20]; [@B3]; [@B5]). The initial rise in Ca^2+^ concentration that is elicited by S9380 is more rapid than the rise induced by caffeine, but it is not clear if this is due to an effect on SR Ca^2+^ release or due to a direct effect on Ca^2+^ influx. However, this rapid rise in Ca^2+^ concentration is rapidly attenuated by the presence of the RyR inhibitor, ryanodine

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9383 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9383 is based on the inhibition of Nrf2 by promoting its proteasomal degradation through the activation of proteasome-mediated p62 degradation. Therefore, the induction of Nrf2 degradation could lead to the suppression of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress, which could be beneficial for the survival of cancer cells.

In conclusion, our study showed that S9383 has the potential to be developed as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9400 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9400 is to inhibit the activity of the IMPDH enzyme, which is essential for the production of guanine nucleotides in the cell. This enzyme is responsible for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. The lack of guanine nucleotides in the cell results in the death of the cell. S9400 inhibits the activity of the IMPDH enzyme by binding to it and by occupying the active site of the enzyme, preventing the production of guanine nucleotides. This results in a reduced proliferation of the cancer cells.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study in patients with advanced, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had received prior docetaxel, the overall response rate (ORR) was 22% in the S9400 group and 0% in the placebo group. Median

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9413 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9413 is similar to that of luteolin and may be associated with the modulation of Nrf2/ARE signaling. The Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway is a critical cytoprotective mechanism that plays a major role in protecting cells against a variety of noxious stimuli, including ROS and reactive nitrogen species \[[@B18-ijms-18-01991]\]. Under oxidative stress conditions, Nrf2 is released from the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) protein and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) \[[@B19-ijms-18-01991]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S9416 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S9416 is currently unknown, but the addition of folic acid to the growth medium is required for the compound to be effective. Folic acid is a component of the folate cycle, a major pathway of one-carbon metabolism that generates the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The SAM-dependent methyltransferases are essential for nucleic acid and protein synthesis and cellular methylation processes. Therefore, it is likely that S9416 affects cellular metabolism by interfering with the folate cycle.

S9416 is an analogue of the antimetabolite of folate, methotrexate (MTX). MTX has been widely used for treatment of a variety of malignancies, including leukaemia and lymphoma, since the 1970s. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms of action of MTX are still not fully understood. In vitro, MTX binds to the dihydrofolate reductase

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Salidroside is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Salidroside is poorly understood. As an AMPK activator, it may exert its anti-diabetic effect via AMPK-mediated pathways. This is because AMPK is an important regulator of glucose metabolism in cells and is considered a master metabolic regulator. The stimulation of AMPK is the main mechanism by which metformin and other anti-diabetic drugs reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes ([@b31-mmr-17-06-7627]). As the only upstream kinase of AMPK, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates ACC, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, and is the major target of ACC inhibition ([@b32-mmr-17-06-7627]). As a consequence, the activity of ACC is decreased and the activity of FAS is inhibited. These two reactions lead to the suppression of fatty acid synthesis, thus leading to the decreased production of malony

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S.A.S.-500 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S.A.S.-500 is a very strong anti-inflammatory and is thought to work by increasing the local levels of adenosine and adenosine receptors.

Adenosine is an endogenous compound that is naturally produced in the body. The highest levels are found in the brain, and it is an important signalling molecule that modulates a variety of physiological processes, including the immune response. Adenosine exerts its effects by binding to cell surface adenosine receptors, which are part of a family of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are located on a wide variety of cells including immune cells and are involved in many of the physiological responses of the immune system.

The actions of adenosine on cells are regulated by a second messenger system, which involves a cyclic AMP cascade. The primary role of this pathway is to regulate cellular functions such as growth and proliferation.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Sasapyrine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Sasapyrine is as follows:

Sasapyrine inhibits bacterial and fungal β-lactamase enzymes by binding to the β-lactamase active site. This binding leads to distortion of the β-lactam ring and results in the inhibition of β-lactamase activity. Sasapyrine inhibits β-lactamase enzymes in the bacterial cell and, therefore, can act as a synergistic combination agent when combined with β-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.

Sasapyrine is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. The active form is (+)-sasapyrin (1) (i.e., the enantiomer with the (-)-stereochemistry at C-7), whereas the inactive form is (-)-sasapyrin (2) (i.e., the enantiomer

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of SCH-527123 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of SCH-527123 is to inhibit the release of preformed and newly synthesized TNF-α from activated macrophages. In the present study, the direct effect of SCH-527123 on TNF-α production was examined in isolated human monocytes and THP-1 cells. SCH-527123 (1 μM) had no effect on TNF-α production by isolated human monocytes stimulated with either zymosan or lipopolysaccharide. However, in THP-1 cells, SCH-527123 inhibited the zymosan-induced production of TNF-α. The production of TNF-α by THP-1 cells was also inhibited by an antibody to TNF-α. These results suggest that SCH-527123 inhibits TNF-α production in THP-1 cells, but not in isolated human monocytes, and that the inhibition is dependent on the formation of active T

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of SCH727965 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of SCH727965 is believed to involve inhibition of the initial steps of HIV-1 replication, which include the binding of the virus to CD4, the co-receptor for the entry of the virus into cells, and the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.

Treatment with SCH727965 resulted in a decrease in viral RNA levels in cell-free and cell-associated virus, and a decrease in HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in the periphery.

The trial also assessed the safety and tolerability of SCH727965 in patients with HIV-1 infection.

There were no safety concerns with SCH727965 in the treatment groups, and the adverse events reported in the study were consistent with those expected in patients with HIV-1 infection.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of scyllo-Inositol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of scyllo-Inositol is not fully understood. Studies with cells and animals have shown that scyllo-Inositol decreases blood glucose levels and improves glucose metabolism.

Inositol is a six-carbon sugar found in every cell in the body. Inositol is required for the formation of cell membranes, which allows cells to function.

While inositol is used by cells to make certain hormones, such as insulin and serotonin, it is also used by the brain to make dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps control the movement of thoughts and actions.

When inositol is consumed by the body, it is converted into glucose. Studies have shown that inositol improves the body's ability to metabolize sugar.

When the body has a surplus of glucose, it converts it into energy.

According to the Mayo Clinic, inositol has been used to treat diabetes for more than 50 years.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Serotonin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Serotonin is an ancient one. Originally, it was thought to be responsible for the coiling of the embryo into a round form. As Serotonin is an amine, and amines are the smallest of the amino acids, this would mean that Serotonin is the smallest of the amino acids.

However, in 1974, researchers found that Serotonin can also act as a hormone. This is because Serotonin can be converted into 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is the active form of Serotonin. This discovery opened the door for further research into the role of Serotonin in the human body.

Today, Serotonin is known to have an effect on the immune system, as well as the cardiovascular system.

Serotonin has been found to be a neurohormone. In the hypothalamus of the brain, Serotonin is believed to be responsible for hunger and satiety.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Sertaconazole is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Sertaconazole is the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14-α demethylase. This enzyme is responsible for demethylation of lanosterol, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of ergosterol. The effect of Sertaconazole is therefore to prevent the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. Ergosterol is a major component of the fungal cell membrane. Sertaconazole is highly active against yeasts, moulds and dermatophytes, but has little activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
Sertaconazole is marketed as a tablet, and has been found to be effective in the treatment of infections caused by fungi, including those that cause dermatomycosis, for example Tinea pedis, Tinea corporis, Tinea cruris, Tinea versicolor and Tinea unguium, as well as for treating fungal infections of the nails.

Response: The mechanism of action of Sevoflurane is still not well understood. Sevoflurane has been reported to activate both GABAA and glycine receptors and the mechanism of the induction of anesthesia is thought to be related to the blockade of these receptors. It has been shown that GABA~A~ receptor activation causes the opening of the chloride channel which leads to hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. When this membrane potential is reduced, the activation of inhibitory neurons is reduced, leading to anesthetic action \[[@B1]\].

Response: The mechanism of action of SNX5422 is summarized in [Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}.

Inhibition of endosomal trafficking
===================================

SNX5422 is an inhibitor of endosomal trafficking. The primary mode of action of SNX5422 is to inhibit the function of Vps35, a subunit of the retromer complex, which mediates endosome-to-TGN transport of membrane receptors ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}). The retromer complex is composed of two core subunits, Vps26 and Vps29, and the SNX subunit Vps35. The retromer complex is required for efficient recycling of the transferrin receptor (TfR) and other receptors to the plasma membrane ([@bib12]; [@bib11]; [@bib23]).

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Sofosbuvir(PSI-7977) is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Sofosbuvir(PSI-7977) is complex. The proposed mechanism of action of Sofosbuvir is outlined in [Fig. 1](#f0005){ref-type="fig"}. Sofosbuvir has a unique mechanism of action, which may be a key to the drug's therapeutic efficacy. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits the HCV RNA polymerase, leading to chain termination and inhibition of RNA synthesis. This is similar to the mechanism of action of other nucleoside and nucleotide analogue inhibitors of the HCV RNA polymerase. However, unlike other nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, Sofosbuvir is phosphorylated to its active triphosphate form by cellular kinases. This active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir has an affinity for the HCV NS5B protein that is 1000-fold greater than its affinity for cellular kinases, and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of S-(+)-Rolipram is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of S-(+)-Rolipram is as follows:

S-(+)-Rolipram is a selective PDE4 inhibitor. The PDE4 enzyme is expressed in immune cells, where it is responsible for the deactivation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by catalyzing its hydrolysis to 5′-AMP. cAMP is a key intracellular second messenger involved in many cellular processes. It is formed by the phosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by adenylyl cyclase. In a cell, the enzyme adenylyl cyclase is activated by the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Gs, which binds Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase to catalyze the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP. The enzyme is then inhibited by the action of phosphodiesterases, such as PDE4. The inhibition of PDE4

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Sulfamethazine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Sulfamethazine is not clearly understood. However, it is likely that sulfamethazine exerts its antimicrobial activity by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane by binding to the cell membrane phospholipids, disturbing the permeability barrier and reducing the activity of enzymes and DNA synthesis. It is also thought that sulfamethazine causes changes in the cellular structure of bacteria.

Sulfamethazine is metabolized in the liver and then excreted in the urine. The half-life of sulfamethazine is about 4-6 hours in dogs. The metabolites of sulfamethazine are not very toxic and are generally not detected in the urine.

Sulfamethazine should not be used in animals with any type of renal or hepatic disease, and should be used cautiously in animals with a history of sensitivity to sulfonamides.

The safety of sulfamethazine in pregnant animals has not been established. However

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Sulindac is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Sulindac is based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2. These enzymes are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and cancer. This dual inhibition leads to the production of different metabolites from the precursor arachidonic acid, which includes the formation of 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (15-keto-PGE2) and 15-keto-prostaglandin F2a (15-keto-PGF2a). 15-keto-PGE2 has been shown to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of Sulindac. In addition, it has been shown to exert antiproliferative effects in a variety of cell types.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tamibarotene is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tamibarotene is complex. It is a potent pan-retinoic acid receptor agonist. This property results in the inhibition of the cell cycle in S-phase and cell death in G2 and M phase. This compound also causes a complete blockade of transcriptional activation of target genes, and induction of expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the repair of DNA. Tamibarotene inhibits the activity of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and induces apoptosis in IDO-expressing cells. This results in an increase in tryptophan levels and a decrease in kynurenine levels, which leads to the activation of the T cell response and the elimination of cancer cells. The anticancer effect of Tamibarotene was tested in several cancer models in vivo, including breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of TARACTAN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of TARACTAN is the creation of a protective matrix which mimics the extracellular matrix and is rich in glycosaminoglycans, which is believed to act as a barrier against microbial penetration. In a clinical trial, a 2% TARACTAN solution was found to be more effective than a 2% chlorhexidine solution in reducing the bacterial count of the primary dentin surface, and also in reducing the occurrence of recurrent caries. However, in a recent in vitro study, it was found that 2% TARACTAN solution alone was ineffective in reducing bacterial adhesion to the dentin surface. A combination of 2% TARACTAN and 0.2% chlorhexidine solution, or 0.2% chlorhexidine alone, were more effective in reducing bacterial adhesion.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tartaric is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tartaric is complicated and involves activation of multiple pathways. It can be classified as an agonist of mGluR5. It also acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) which catalyzes the condensation of the three carbon moieties of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to produce farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Inhibition of FDPS leads to a reduction in the availability of the substrates IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which in turn leads to inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. The resultant increase in the concentration of acetyl-CoA and inhibition of the citrate cycle leads to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This results in increased autophagy and subsequent degradation of p62, which is associated with the mGluR5 receptor.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Telatinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Telatinib is yet to be understood, but its mode of action is similar to the approved small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A previous study demonstrated that Telatinib inhibits the phosphorylation of several tyrosine kinases in vitro and also causes a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases in A549 cells ([@bib15]). It is also known that the function of the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is regulated by phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain ([@bib4]). In the current study, we investigated whether Telatinib has an effect on the IGF-1R in HCC cells. Our results indicate that Telatinib inhibits the IGF-1R and causes apoptosis of HCC cells. These results suggest that Telatinib may be a novel treatment for HCC.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tenofovir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tenofovir is not fully understood. In a study, performed by Thomas and his colleagues, the researchers were able to show that the drug binds to the HIV-1 RT enzyme. Tenofovir inhibits the enzyme’s ability to make DNA by competitively binding to the enzyme’s DNA-binding pocket. This causes the accumulation of incomplete DNA strands which leads to a reduction in the amount of HIV-1 DNA in the cell. As a result, the number of infected cells drops significantly.

The primary concern with Tenofovir is the fact that the drug also binds to mitochondrial DNA, which can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This results in the generation of reactive oxygen species which damage the cell. The potential long-term side effects of Tenofovir include the potential for long-term kidney damage.

The potential for side effects of Tenofovir is similar to that of other antiretroviral drugs. The drug

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of terfenadine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of terfenadine is believed to be based on its ability to block an enzyme, histamine H1-receptor, thereby reducing the physiological and pharmacological actions of histamine (intravenously administered histamine produces cardio-inhibition and an increase in blood pressure). Terfenadine has also been shown to reduce the amount of dopamine released from neuron-containing areas of the brain that are believed to be involved in the brain control of bodily states (such as rest, exercise and emotion). Terfenadine has also been shown to reduce the sensitivity of the body's fight or flight response.
Although terfenadine has a long history of safety in humans, it is now known that certain individuals experience serious side effects when taking terfenadine. Seizures have been reported in association with the use of terfenadine.

Response: The mechanism of action of Tetracaine is not fully understood. One theory is that Tetracaine acts by blocking sodium channels, thereby blocking nerve impulses. This would explain the mechanism of action of Tetracaine for pain relief, but would not explain the mechanism of action for anesthesia. It is possible that Tetracaine may act as an anesthetic by blocking the nerve fibers, thereby preventing them from carrying nerve impulses. The presence of Tetracaine in the nerve endings may also block the release of pain inducing chemicals from the nerve endings. This would explain the mechanism of action for anesthesia, but would not explain the mechanism of action for pain relief.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ticagrelor is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ticagrelor is well understood, but there is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of Ticagrelor in older patients, in whom the incidence of bleeding and thrombotic events is increased.

Ticagrelor is an oral, direct, and reversible P2Y12 platelet receptor antagonist, which selectively blocks ADP-mediated platelet activation. The drug reversibly inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of normal circulating concentrations of ADP. Ticagrelor binds reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor, which is responsible for platelet aggregation in response to ADP. Ticagrelor selectively inhibits the P2Y12 receptor, and its major active metabolite reversibly inhibits the ADP receptor (P2Y1).

Ticagrelor has demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In the PL

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ticarcillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ticarcillin is based on the fact that the Ticarcillin molecule has an affinity for the Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) present in the bacterial cell membrane. The Penicillin-binding proteins are responsible for the biosynthesis of the cell wall. Ticarcillin also has an affinity for certain bacterial enzymes, which are responsible for the synthesis of cell wall components. The interaction of Ticarcillin with the Penicillin-binding proteins and bacterial enzymes results in the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and hence inhibits the growth of the bacteria.

Uses of Ticarcillin

Ticarcillin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Ticarcillin is used to treat infections caused by certain types of gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and E. coli. It is also used to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Klebsiella

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tideglusib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tideglusib is by blocking a critical kinase that is required for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). These kinases are required for the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which leads to its detachment from microtubules and to the aggregation of tau in the neurofibrillary tangles. Thus, tau phosphorylation by CDK5 and GSK3β is thought to be a key step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

The patient was given a daily dose of Tideglusib of 10 mg. She was given 6 cycles of treatment, with each cycle consisting of a 2-week on-treatment phase followed by a 2-week off-treatment phase. Her serum amyloid A levels fell from 13.9 to 7.9 mg/dL, her total

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tilmicosin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tilmicosin is not fully understood. However, a likely mode of action is through the inhibition of the enzyme(s) involved in the final stage of lipid synthesis, namely the synthesis of lipid II, which is a common precursor for both cell wall and cell membrane formation. Lipid II is a phosphorylated lipoglycan and has been proposed to be an essential intermediate in the synthesis of cell wall and cell membrane. The proposed mechanism of action of Tilmicosin is by the inhibition of the formation of lipid II. This would inhibit the synthesis of cell wall and cell membrane and may interfere with bacterial replication and viability.

A combination of cefquinome and Tilmicosin in the treatment of bovine respiratory disease was studied by [@bib6]. The objective of this study was to determine the most effective and economical antimicrobial regimen in the treatment of bovine respiratory disease. Cefquinome (CEF) and Til

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Timonacic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Timonacic is unique and unlike any other heart drug currently available. By restoring the sensitivity of the heart muscle to calcium, Timonacic enables the heart muscle to beat at a normal rate, and the heart to recover from ischemia. The drug also stimulates the heart to beat at a higher rate than would normally occur, thereby maximizing the amount of oxygen delivered to the heart and brain during an ischemic event.

Sensitivity to Calcium

In the absence of Timonacic, the heart muscle is unable to respond to the calcium signals that normally cause it to contract. Timonacic restores the sensitivity of the heart muscle to calcium. Timonacic works by increasing the sensitivity of the heart muscle to calcium, so that it can respond to normal levels of calcium. In other words, Timonacic enhances the sensitivity of the heart muscle to calcium. The calcium sensitivity of the heart muscle is often called the calcium transient

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tiotropium is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tiotropium is based on the stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves that regulate the secretory activity of the airways, thus preventing bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle relaxation. Tiotropium improves the control of the airways and thus increases the respiratory efficiency and the quality of life of patients with COPD ([@b1-etm-0-0-8996]). Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic drug that reduces airway resistance, improves the symptoms of patients with COPD and is well tolerated ([@b2-etm-0-0-8996]). It has been shown that patients with COPD have a higher mortality rate compared with the general population, mainly due to respiratory complications. The main cause of this increased mortality is the chronic, progressive nature of COPD and not the comorbidities. Patients with COPD have a significantly higher mortality rate compared with the general population, with

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tirapazamine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tirapazamine is similar to that of Temozolomide (TMZ) in that both are prodrugs. Temozolomide is an alkylating agent that is activated by intracellular dioxygenases and forms DNA-alkylating adducts. TMZ is converted to the active alkylating species Temozolomide-M1 (TMZ-M1) by the cytosolic alkylating enzymes O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and/or aza-dioxygenases. In contrast, Tirapazamine is activated by the cytosolic tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP-1), which causes the activation of the drug by the hydrolysis of the ester group. Thus, the two mechanisms of action are very different and each has the potential to provide a unique clinical profile.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tirofiban is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tirofiban is believed to be mediated through binding to GPIIb/IIIa on the surface of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is an integrin receptor, which is expressed on the surface of platelets and plays a role in platelet aggregation. GPIIb/IIIa is also expressed on other cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells.
The ability of Tirofiban to inhibit platelet aggregation is believed to be important for its efficacy in preventing restenosis. However, it is believed that the efficacy of Tirofiban is not limited to inhibiting platelet aggregation, but is also due to its anti-inflammatory activity.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tolbutamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tolbutamide is not well known, but may be due to a combination of peripheral and central nervous system effects. Tolbutamide is a weak α-glucosidase inhibitor and reduces glucose absorption from the small intestine. It is also a weak inhibitor of pancreatic α-amylase, and therefore slows the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the small intestine.

Mechanism of action

Tolbutamide is an oral hypoglycemic drug that acts by inhibiting the enzyme which is involved in the formation of glucose. This drug is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme.

Tolbutamide acts by decreasing the absorption of glucose from the intestine, which slows the rise in blood glucose after a meal.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tolcapone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tolcapone is not fully understood. It has been suggested that Tolcapone acts through inhibition of MAO-B. The MAO-B inhibitory action of Tolcapone is very weak and it is suggested that the MAO-B inhibitory activity is a side effect of the drug. Another possibility is that Tolcapone may act through the inhibition of other neurotransmitter receptors. Tolcapone has been shown to act at dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors. Tolcapone is reported to act as a potent and selective antagonist at the D2 and D3 receptors, with a preference for the D2 receptor.

Mechanism of action

Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter in the brain. It is released by the cell body of the neuron, and is taken up again by the terminals of the neuron, where it is then broken down. DA plays a role in regulating the activity of neurons, and is

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of tolmetin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of tolmetin is still not completely understood. One of the major events that occurs during tolmetin-induced cytotoxicity is the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. A new inhibitor of cytochrome c translocation, 2-cyano-3-(2-diethylaminoethylthiocarbamoyl) propionitrile (Y-27632), was recently reported to inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria induced by several apoptotic inducers. We investigated the effect of Y-27632 on tolmetin-induced apoptosis. Y-27632 prevented tolmetin-induced translocation of cytochrome c to the cytosol and the subsequent activation of caspase-3. Y-27632 also inhibited tolmetin-induced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tolnaftate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tolnaftate is based on the conversion of toxic allergens into less toxic forms by means of a catalytic process. This process results in a chemical transformation of the allergens into water-soluble molecules which are then absorbed and excreted by the body. The transformation process is the result of an enzymatic activity (acyltransferase) carried by the animal body. The biological activity of Tolnaftate is similar to that of indomethacin, another NSAID, but the chemical structure of Tolnaftate differs significantly from indomethacin.

Indomethacin and Tolnaftate are not metabolized in the liver and have no effect on the kidneys.

These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of eczema and other dermatological disorders. They are also used for the relief of pain, for the prevention of migraine, and for the treatment of arthritis and rheumatism.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tolvaptan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tolvaptan is similar to that of other vasopressin receptor antagonists such as the competitive V2 receptor antagonist dDAVP and the selective V2 receptor agonist AVP. However, tolvaptan differs from these agents in that it acts directly on the renal collecting duct to inhibit the action of vasopressin.

Because of its pharmacokinetic profile, tolvaptan is administered orally once daily in a single dose of 15 mg. In the OPTIMAL study, adult patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L) received a single oral dose of 15 mg of tolvaptan.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Topotecan is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Topotecan is based on the inhibition of the DNA-Topoisomerase I (Topo I). The therapeutic efficacy of Topotecan is related to the specific binding of Topotecan to Topo I, resulting in DNA-Topo I complex formation. The complex is bound to DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis and transcription. The Topotecan-Topo I complex is also converted into an apoptotic complex, and the cytotoxic effect of Topotecan is mediated by the DNA strand breakage, leading to the activation of caspase-3, which is a key component of the apoptotic machinery.

For a successful Topotecan therapy, there are some important aspects that should be considered. The determination of the optimal dose of Topotecan is an important issue. A dose of 0.4 mg/m^2^ is the recommended dose, based on clinical studies of ovarian cancer patients \

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Torcetrapib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Torcetrapib is very well understood. This drug has been used as a tool to understand the function of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). However, the functional importance of this protein and its role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway is still not well understood. A large body of evidence suggests that CETP is not only a modulator of HDL but it is also involved in the cellular uptake of HDL. Recently, a new mechanism of action of CETP has been proposed by Zhu et al. \[[@B1]\]. They showed that CETP is a receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and that this interaction is important for cellular uptake of HDL. OxLDL has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases \[[@B2]\].

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Trimebutine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Trimebutine is not fully understood. It is thought to act on the central nervous system by a combination of anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and sedative effects. This sedative effect of Trimebutine is attributed to its anticholinergic properties. Trimebutine is believed to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system by binding to acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system. Trimebutine also acts as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. This action, in turn, results in increased levels of acetylcholine at synapses. The effects of Trimebutine on the central nervous system may also be due to its antihistaminic properties. Trimebutine is a non-specific muscarinic antagonist. Trimebutine binds with higher affinity to muscarinic receptors than atropine, and is believed to have a greater affinity for the M1 receptor subtype.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Trimetazidine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Trimetazidine is not fully understood but the drug acts by inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. Trimetazidine is well tolerated and has few side effects.

Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, Trimetazidine appears to have a number of beneficial actions. These include:

It is not clear whether Trimetazidine should be considered a first-line treatment or a treatment of last resort in patients with chronic stable angina.

The best evidence is that Trimetazidine should be used in patients who have angina or angina equivalent to Class I-II of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification.

Treatment with Trimetazidine should be initiated at a dose of 30 mg three times a day and may be increased up to a maximum of 60 mg three times a day. It is not known if this dose should be taken on an empty stomach or with food.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Trimethoprim is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Trimethoprim is as follows:
1) This drug is a prodrug that is converted by bacterial enzymes to an active metabolite.
2) The active metabolite is transported across the cell membrane and then converted to a toxic compound that interferes with the growth of the bacteria.
The metabolite has a high degree of toxicity against certain strains of bacteria. The toxicity is enhanced by the presence of an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase, which reduces the metabolite to a toxic compound.
Trimethoprim is one of the oldest antibacterial agents, having been used in human and veterinary medicine since the 1940s. It is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of trimipramine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of trimipramine is not known, but it may inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the presynaptic neuron, thereby increasing the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. It may also enhance the activity of serotonergic receptors in the central nervous system. Trimipramine has been found to inhibit the uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. Trimipramine also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin in platelets, which may be the reason for the anti-depressant effect of the drug. Trimipramine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine in the heart, thereby increasing the availability of norepinephrine at adrenergic receptors. The inhibitory effects of trimipramine on the reuptake of norepinephrine in the heart may be the reason for the cardiovascular side effects of the drug.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Triptolide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Triptolide is based on the ability of the compound to target specific molecular events that lead to the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. A large number of signaling pathways, transcription factors and genes, cell cycle proteins, cell cycle regulators, and pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, are modulated by Triptolide, thus leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. Triptolide induces apoptosis by the following mechanisms: (1) binding to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule assembly and blocking cell cycle progression; (2) binding to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone, preventing the formation of the Hsp90/p53/Mdm2 complex and inducing the release of the transcription factor p53, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; (3) binding to the co-chaperone Cdc37, promoting the

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Troglitazone is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Troglitazone is not yet fully understood, but it has been suggested that it acts by improving insulin sensitivity, and by decreasing the inflammatory response in insulin resistant patients \[[@B11]\].

According to a study, done by Oster et al. \[[@B12]\], there was a decrease in the lipid levels and an increase in the HDL levels after Troglitazone therapy. They suggested that the decreased lipid levels may be the result of the improvement in insulin sensitivity, and the increased HDL levels may be due to the improvement in insulin sensitivity and/or a direct effect on the hepatic cells. In our study, we found that there was a significant decrease in the lipid levels after therapy.

In our study, there was a significant decrease in the mean CRP level after treatment. This decrease was found in both groups.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Trometamol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Trometamol is based on the inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, a specific enzyme that breaks down the messenger molecule cyclic AMP, thereby enhancing the levels of this molecule in the body. This, in turn, increases the activity of the parathyroid gland, which in turn increases the level of calcium in the blood. The effect of Trometamol on calcium levels is short-lived, and it has no effect on blood pressure. The mechanism of action of Trometamol has been proven in controlled clinical studies. In the United States, Trometamol is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tropic is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tropic is not clear. The endocannabinoid system is involved in many physiological functions. The first identified cannabinoid receptor was discovered in 1990 and was named after the plant from which the first active ingredients were isolated. Cannabinoids are a group of lipophilic compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors and activate them.

Tropic is a cannabis-based product, which means that it contains a high level of CBD and a low level of THC. The cannabinoid ratio of this product is 20:1, which means that it has more CBD than THC. Many of the other cannabis-based products on the market have a very low CBD:THC ratio, which means that the CBD doesn’t do much for you and the THC can be pretty high.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Tulobuterol is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Tulobuterol is thought to be a result of the drug's ability to stimulate β2-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells in the bronchial tree. This stimulation causes relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle, and this in turn leads to a reduction in the production of mucus and inflammation, as well as an increase in mucociliary clearance.

It is a non-selective β2-agonist that works by stimulating the β2-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells. These receptors are found in the bronchial smooth muscle, and are involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. This is thought to be the mechanism of action of Tulobuterol.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of TYZEKA is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of TYZEKA is as follows: TYZEKA works on the principle of adjusting the balance between the right and left side of the brain. This leads to a healthier brain, and an improved sense of balance and coordination. TYZEKA also works on the principle of strengthening the connection between the brain and the body, which makes the brain work as it should. This also helps to improve balance and coordination.

How does TYZEKA work?

TYZEKA works by strengthening the connection between the brain and the body. This is achieved by working on the left side of the brain. The right side of the brain is the dominant side, and is responsible for functions such as processing information, judgement, and creativity. The left side of the brain is responsible for functions such as thinking, processing information, and physical coordination.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Ulipristal is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Ulipristal is similar to that of mifepristone. The action of Ulipristal in the first phase of the menstrual cycle is mediated by blocking the effects of progesterone, which is responsible for the thickening of the cervical mucus. The thickening of the cervical mucus prevents the sperm from reaching the fallopian tubes. In the second phase of the menstrual cycle, Ulipristal binds to the progesterone receptor, which causes the release of oestrogen and thus causes menstruation.

The other advantage of Ulipristal is that it is not only effective but also safe, as it does not affect the quality of the oocytes. However, Ulipristal should be used for only one cycle. The safety of Ulipristal has been proven in a study where the efficacy of Ulipristal in combination with mifepristone has been compared with mifepristone alone.

The first-line treatment of migraine is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or triptans. While NSAIDs have been shown to be effective, their use is associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding, and many patients are reluctant to take these medications because of their side effects. Triptans are also effective in the acute treatment of migraine. However, their use is associated with a number of potential side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, chest pressure, and photophobia.

Response: The mechanism of action of Uridine is not known. There are at least two mechanisms of action. The first is to replace pyrimidine and purine nucleotides in the genome and to repair genetic errors. The second is to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. It has been reported that Uridine increases the amount of intracellular 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) by an intracellular phosphorylation and also inhibits the metabolism of 5-FU by competing with its synthesis. Uridine inhibits DNA synthesis in cells at the level of nucleic acid biosynthesis and, when used in combination with 5-FU, causes synergistic effects in killing tumor cells.

Valaciclovir was the first TK inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes (Gardner, W. R. et al. (1998) Am. J. Med. 105, 33-38).
The standard oral dose of valaciclovir is 500 mg three times a day (tid). Although oral administration of valaciclovir results in higher blood levels than intravenous administration, oral administration is not without side effects. One of the most serious side effects is nephrotoxicity. In clinical trials of treatment of recurrent genital herpes, the most common adverse events included headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. The incidence

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Valethamate is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Valethamate is not known, but it is possible that it acts on the gut, which is a common site for the action of thiocolchicine, which is also a glucosamine derivative.

Clinical studies 

Valethamate is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of conditions. In one clinical trial, valethamate was found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraines in women. Another clinical trial found valethamate to be effective in reducing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, although it did not alter the condition's underlying inflammation.

Safety 

Valethamate is generally considered to be safe, although like other thiocolchicine derivatives, it can cause photosensitivity and can cause stomach pain.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of valganciclovir is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of valganciclovir is through inhibition of DNA synthesis and the purine analogue is incorporated into DNA. However, it is not incorporated into the viral DNA, but rather into the cellular DNA, resulting in inhibition of viral replication. The drug is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite by a catabolic pathway involving two enzymes: cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK).\[[@ref1]\]

The oral bioavailability of valganciclovir is about 75% and the drug undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, with a systemic exposure of about 60%.\[[@ref2]\]

The recommended dose of valganciclovir for prophylaxis and treatment of CMV infection is 900 mg orally twice daily (BID).\[[@ref3]\]

Response: The mechanism of action of Valnemulin is the same as that of Raxil (macrolide) which was used as the comparator for the study. It inhibits the production of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1, and PGE2, and is a potent immunomodulator. It also inhibits macrophage phagocytosis and adhesion to endothelial cells and it enhances the binding of lymphocytes to endothelial cells \[[@b3-medscimonit-20-2082]\].

The drug was well tolerated in this study, with no adverse effects reported. The safety profile was comparable to that of Raxil.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VALSARTAN is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VALSARTAN is different from that of other ARBs. Valsartan does not act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) or vasopressin, and the blood pressure lowering effect of valsartan is due to the inhibition of AT1 receptor (AR) on the vascular smooth muscle cells.\[[@ref1]\] Valsartan inhibits the production of AT1 receptor and activates AT2 receptor,\[[@ref2]\] which is an important counter regulatory system in maintaining blood pressure. In animal models of hypertension, valsartan not only inhibited AT1 receptor, but also increased the levels of AT2 receptor.\[[@ref3]\] In patients with heart failure, valsartan increased the cardiac AT2 receptor.\[[@ref4]\] These findings are of importance in the pathogenesis of hypertension and heart failure.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Vanillin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Vanillin is still not clear, but it is possible that it inhibits the phosphorylation of AMPK by the upstream kinases, such as LKB1, CAMKK2, or CaMKK, or by the activation of PP2A. It has been shown that AMPK inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by the inhibition of the activity of K~ATP~ channels in pancreatic β-cells ([@bib13]), and that AMPK activation by Vanillin is involved in the glucose-lowering effect of metformin in HepG2 cells ([@bib20]). Therefore, the activation of AMPK by Vanillin might also be involved in the reduction of glucose uptake and/or the inhibition of gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Vardenafil is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Vardenafil is not completely understood. Vardenafil is believed to increase the duration of sexual activity by improving the quality of erection. This improvement is due to the increased duration of smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow to the penis. Vardenafil may also improve the erection by increasing the duration of nitric oxide release. Vardenafil may increase the blood flow to the penis by increasing the dilation of the arteries in the penis.
Vardenafil is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Vardenafil is also indicated as a treatment for premature ejaculation (PE) in men. Vardenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, a vasodilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. It increases blood flow to the penis by relaxing the smooth muscles of the penis.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Varenicline is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Varenicline is believed to be mediated by antagonism of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). A key issue in the development of α4β2 nAChR ligands is the problem of the relative binding affinities of the agonist, nicotine, and the antagonists, α4β2 nAChR ligands, for the receptor.

The development of new compounds with the capacity to differentiate between the functional and the pharmacological activity of the receptor has become a major goal in the research of nAChR ligands. This is a particular challenge in the case of α4β2 nAChRs because of the existence of multiple allosteric binding sites on the receptor and the close homology between α4 and α7 nAChR subunits.

Previous studies have shown that the functional affinity of a ligand can be differentiated from its binding affinity by the

Response: The mechanism of action of ARRY-334543 is not completely understood. However, it is believed that the compound binds to the A2B adenosine receptor, which is a Gi-coupled receptor. The A2B adenosine receptor is expressed on various cell types, such as platelets, endothelial cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and macrophages. A2B adenosine receptors are also expressed on airway smooth muscle cells, where they regulate cell proliferation and are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. The A2B adenosine receptor has been suggested to be a promising drug target for the treatment of asthma, because selective antagonists of the A2B adenosine receptor have been shown to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness in animal models of asthma. In addition, it has been shown that A2B adenosine receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of disorders

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VIDAZA is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VIDAZA is based on the expression of the EGFR receptor on the surface of a cell. EGFR belongs to a family of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (Herbst and Shin, J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 2836-2842) that play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The activation of EGFR occurs when a ligand binds to its extracellular domain. EGFR is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, such as breast, lung, head and neck, ovary, colon, and pancreas. The overexpression of EGFR correlates with a poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy. Thus, EGFR inhibition represents a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer.
Inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR have been described (Chan, W. C. et al.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Vitamin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Vitamin is by preventing free radicals from damaging your DNA, which in turn helps protect your cells. This is known as free radical scavenging. Free radicals are naturally occurring in the body, but are also produced as byproducts of metabolism. Free radicals can cause cell damage, which may be linked to many of the conditions that people with vitiligo suffer from.

Free radicals are produced by oxidation of certain chemicals and vitamins in the body. Antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, E, and zinc, help to neutralise these free radicals.

The problem is that when a person’s skin is exposed to the sun, free radicals are produced at a faster rate than the body can counteract them. In people with vitiligo, the skin is unable to produce sufficient amounts of these natural antioxidants, and so the body’s antioxidant defences are not sufficient to neutralise the free radicals.

Inhibition of HDAC activity has been shown to induce acetylation of histones and transcription factors that lead to changes in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and cell survival. (I) In addition to HDAC inhibition, the class of compounds known as proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are also known to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. PIs function by blocking the degradation of proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). (J) Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to cause G1 arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. A recent study showed that the transcription factor E2F1 is a substrate of the proteasome and that its degradation is regulated by PI-induced inhibition of E2F1 ubiquitination. (K) It is hypothesized that the transcription factor E2F1 plays a key role in regulating the expression of the cyclin

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VTX-2337 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VTX-2337 is complex, and a detailed discussion of this mechanism is beyond the scope of this report. However, it is worth noting that VTX-2337 is a new class of synthetic antifungal agent that inhibits fungal membrane ergosterol biosynthesis, and this novel mechanism of action differs from that of azole and polyene antifungal agents. It is also worth noting that VTX-2337 is not a broad spectrum agent and does not inhibit growth of other organisms such as bacteria.

To evaluate the activity of VTX-2337, we tested its activity against eight pathogenic fungi, including *C. albicans*, *C. glabrata*, *C. krusei*, *C. parapsilosis*, *C. tropicalis*, *A. fumigatus*, *A. nidulans*, and *A. terreus*. VTX-23

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VUMON is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VUMON is based on the ability of CUR to inhibit androgen receptors and aromatase activity. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the level of intracellular androgens, thus leading to an increase in the level of intracellular estrogens and an increase in the aromatase activity. As a result, VUMON is associated with an increase in the estradiol (E2) and decrease in the testosterone (T) concentration. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of VUMON on the E2, T, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in blood plasma. The concentration of E2, T, FSH and LH in the blood plasma of patients with PCOS was significantly higher than in the control group. The concentration of E2 in the blood plasma of patients with PCOS before and after treatment with VUMON was significantly lower than in

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VX661 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VX661 is different from that of gemcitabine and paclitaxel. We found that VX661 inhibited the expression of bcl-2, which is a known marker of MDR. VX661 also increased the level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreased the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis is the mechanism of action of VX661. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies.^[@bib24]^

In the present study, we found that VX661 inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of MDR. The mice tolerated VX661 treatment well, and VX661 treatment had no effect on body weight. Our findings suggest that VX661 is an effective MDR inhibitor.

In summary, we have shown that VX661 reverses MDR and has potent antitumor

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VX-745 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VX-745 is as an inhibitor of PARP1. The activity of PARP1 is required for normal DNA repair and the proper repair of damaged DNA can lead to cell death. PARP1 is involved in many aspects of the DNA damage response. The enzyme recognizes DNA strand breaks, single strand breaks and DNA damage caused by alkylation, ionizing radiation, or oxidative stress. PARP1 is involved in both single strand break repair and base excision repair (BER) and is responsible for the transfer of ADP-ribose units to nuclear proteins such as PARP1 itself, histones, topoisomerase, and transcription factors. Once bound to a protein, PARP1 transfers ADP-ribose units to the acceptor protein. The best known and most important acceptor protein is the PARP1 itself. This results in a cascade of events that leads to a conformational change in PARP1 that causes a loss of its

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of VX-809 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of VX-809 is still not fully understood, but it seems to block the activity of an essential component of the ribosome. As a result, VX-809 affects the synthesis of all proteins in the cell.

This drug is also used to treat another infection caused by HIV called HIV-associated dementia.

This is a completely new type of HIV therapy. The idea is that by blocking the function of a certain component of the HIV virus, it will not be able to replicate in the cell.

As a result, there is no longer any viral activity in the cell.

As with any HIV therapy, VX-809 is not a cure for HIV infection. It will not remove the virus from the body.

However, it will stop the virus from replicating in the body and will slow down the progression of the disease.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of WP1066 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of WP1066 is the result of a strong inhibition of the cdc25A phosphatase activity in vivo, by targeting the active site and not the phosphate-binding pocket \[[@B13-molecules-24-01215]\]. However, this inhibition is not strong enough to induce cell cycle arrest or cell death.

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro activity of WP1066 in five GBM cell lines, to evaluate its efficacy in treating GBM. We have also studied its activity on a U87 cell line model, which is one of the most common GBM models.

We first evaluated the efficacy of WP1066 at IC~50~ and IC~75~, in five GBM cell lines: U251, T98, A172, U87, and A172, which are commonly used as models in research on glioma. In the case of U251 and T98,

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Xanthopterin is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Xanthopterin is still under investigation. It may act by binding to DNA directly or by preventing its binding to other proteins. It is believed that Xanthopterin is an effective drug for the treatment of some forms of cancer, especially leukemias and lymphomas.

In addition, Xanthopterin has been shown to have antimalarial activity. It is thought to act by inhibiting a metabolic pathway involved in the formation of hemoglobin.

In contrast to the commonly used drugs to treat malaria, such as chloroquine and quinine, Xanthopterin is relatively nontoxic.

I have been using Xifaxan for a few months now and am really pleased with the results. My symptoms of bloating and distension are completely gone and I haven't had any more gassiness. I was initially on a very restrictive diet, and then I stopped taking the medication for a few days and I immediately began to experience the same symptoms. I would definitely recommend Xifaxan for anyone suffering from SIBO.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of XL-184 is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of XL-184 is currently unknown. However, there are two known cellular targets for this agent: Topoisomerase II and the molecular chaperone HSP90. It has been demonstrated that XL-184 causes apoptosis in both HSP90- and Topo II-expressing cells \[[@R16]\]. A recent report suggested that the anti-cancer activity of XL-184 was not dependent on HSP90 and that it caused apoptosis via activation of p38 MAPK \[[@R17]\]. In addition, XL-184 has been shown to bind directly to Topo II and inhibit its enzymatic activity \[[@R18]\]. We previously reported that Topo IIα expression is elevated in a number of solid tumor types, including prostate cancer \[[@R19]\]. In addition, Topo IIα expression is an independent prognostic indicator in prostate cancer patients \[[@R19]\

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Zanubrutinib is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Zanubrutinib is unique. It inhibits BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TK) activity through direct interaction with the BCR-ABL TK, and with the ABL SH2 domain, preventing ABL activation and downstream signaling. Inhibition of the ABL TK is associated with inhibition of the growth and proliferation of Ph^+^ CML cells. Zanubrutinib is also an inhibitor of the CXCR4 and CXCR7 chemokine receptors, and has been shown to induce apoptosis in CML cell lines and primary cells. In addition, in vitro studies show that the drug inhibits CML cell growth and proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest and cell death, and increases the susceptibility of CML cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. The drug has been shown to induce apoptosis in cell lines, and is currently being tested in a phase I/II trial

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Zidovudine is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Zidovudine is based on the inhibition of reverse transcriptase (RT), a key enzyme in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Zidovudine binds to the polymerase active site, but is not incorporated into the viral DNA, and thus does not interfere with the elongation of the newly synthesized viral DNA chain. This inhibition is permanent and long lasting, and is thought to be responsible for the therapeutic efficacy of Zidovudine.
Zidovudine is an anti-HIV drug that is widely used to treat HIV infections. The active form of the drug is the 5-iodo-2,4-dideoxypyrimidine nucleoside, which is referred to as AZT or Zidovudine. The structure of the nucleoside is shown below.

Prompt:  The mechanism of action of Zonisamide is
 
Response: The mechanism of action of Zonisamide is not fully understood. It is believed to be due to an inhibition of the sodium channel. This action results in the prolongation of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) phase of the action potential and this in turn is thought to result in a decrease in the firing rate of the neurons. A second mechanism is thought to involve the reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, it is believed to have an action on other channels including the voltage-dependent calcium channels.
